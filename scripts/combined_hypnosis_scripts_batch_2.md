Bring your awareness to your feet, feeling them relax and grow heavy. Let this wave of relaxation move up through your ankles, calves, and knees. Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and lower back, releasing any stiffness. Your abdomen softens, and your chest relaxes with each gentle breath.

Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, through your shoulders, and down your arms to your fingertips. Your neck and jaw relax, your facial muscles soften, and your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm."

**(Deepener - The Mirror of Truth)**

This soothing sensation continues into your hips and lower back, releasing any stiffness. Your abdomen softens, and your chest relaxes with each gentle breath.

Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, through your shoulders, and down your arms to your fingertips. Your neck and jaw relax, your facial muscles soften, and your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm."

**(Deepener - The Release Valve)**

"Imagine a gentle, warm light glowing in the center of your chest. This light represents your inner power and control. Now, imagine that any unwanted habit you wish to release is connected to a small, symbolic valve within this light. As you focus on this valve, you feel a growing sense of readiness to let go. With each breath, you gently turn the valve, allowing the energy of the old habit to flow out and dissipate, leaving you feeling lighter, freer, and more deeply relaxed."

**(Therapeutic Content)**

"Now, in this state of deep relaxation and inner control, bring to mind the specific habit you wish to break. You recognise that this habit is simply an old program running in your subconscious mind, and you have the power to rewrite that program. Any feelings of being stuck, or any resistance to change, simply dissolve and fade away, replaced by a profound sense of empowerment and determination.

Imagine yourself encountering a situation where you would normally engage in the old habit. See yourself pausing, taking a deep breath, and consciously choosing a new, positive action. Perhaps you replace the old habit with a healthy alternative, a moment of mindfulness, or a constructive activity. Feel the satisfaction and pride that comes with making this new, empowering choice.

From this moment forward, you will find it easier to identify the triggers for your old habit and to respond with new, healthier behaviours. Your subconscious mind is now reprogrammed to support your desire for positive change. You are building new neural pathways, strengthening your willpower, and embracing a lifestyle that aligns with your highest values. You are a master of your habits, and you are creating the life you truly desire."

**(Termination)**

"Now, it is time to gently return to your full waking awareness, bringing with you all the positive feelings of control, empowerment, and freedom from unwanted habits. I will count from one to five, and with each number, you will feel more and more alert, refreshed, and ready to engage with your day.

One... beginning to feel a gentle energy returning to your body.
Two... becoming more aware of your surroundings, feeling grounded and present.
Three... feeling refreshed and invigorated, carrying your newfound control over habits with you.
Four... your mind is clear, your body is energised, and you are ready to open your eyes.

# Overcoming Perfectionism

## Introduction

This script is designed to help individuals overcome the debilitating aspects of perfectionism, fostering a healthier approach to tasks, self-acceptance, and progress over unattainable ideals. It aims to reprogram the subconscious mind to embrace 'good enough' and celebrate effort.

## Script

**(Induction - Progressive Relaxation)**

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. Take a deep, calming breath, and as you exhale, release any tension you might be holding. Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation.

Bring your awareness to your feet, feeling them relax and grow heavy. Let this wave of relaxation move up through your ankles, calves, and knees. Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose.

As you observe this river, you feel a profound sense of acceptance for the natural flow of life and work, drawing you deeper into a state of profound peace and understanding."

Any old patterns of impatience, frustration, or a desire for instant gratification simply dissolve and fade away, replaced by a profound sense of self-acceptance and appreciation for progress.

Imagine yourself approaching a task with a healthy desire for quality, but also with a willingness to embrace 'good enough'. You set realistic expectations, you celebrate milestones, and you understand that learning and growth often come from imperfections. You allow yourself to complete tasks, to share your work, and to move forward, knowing that continuous improvement is a journey, not a destination.

From this moment forward, you will find it easier to release the burden of perfectionism. You will instinctively choose progress over paralysis, and self-compassion over harsh self-judgment. You will appreciate your efforts, celebrate your achievements, and learn from your experiences without unnecessary criticism. You are becoming a person who is productive, resilient, and deeply accepting of yourself and your work."

**(Termination)**

"Now, it is time to gently return to your full waking awareness, bringing with you all the positive feelings of self-acceptance, progress, and freedom from debilitating perfectionism.

You will choose to focus on what you can control, and you will release what you cannot. Your mind becomes a clear, calm space, free from unnecessary worry.

Imagine yourself responding to situations that once caused anxiety with a newfound sense of composure and confidence. You are able to think clearly, make rational decisions, and communicate effectively. You trust in your ability to handle challenges, knowing that you have an inner reservoir of strength and resilience. You are cultivating a mindset of peace and calm, empowering you to navigate life with ease."

What insights can you gain that will serve you in your present life? You are safe to explore, knowing that you are always connected to your present self and can return at any time.

Perhaps you discover a talent, a passion, or a challenge that resonates with your current experiences. Understand that these past life experiences can offer profound healing and clarity, helping you to release old patterns, embrace new strengths, and understand your soul's journey. You are gaining wisdom and perspective that empowers your present and future."

**(Transition back to present)**

"Now, it is time to gently bring these insights back with you. Step back through the door, leaving the past life behind, but carrying its wisdom with you. You walk back along the Corridor of Time, feeling lighter, clearer, and more integrated. You are returning to your present self, bringing with you all the valuable lessons and healing from your journey."

**(Termination)**

"Now, it is time to gently return to your full waking awareness, bringing with you all the positive feelings of insight, healing, and understanding from your past life regression. I will count from one to five, and with each number, you will feel more and more alert, refreshed, and ready to engage with your day.

One... beginning to feel a gentle energy returning to your body.
Two... becoming more aware of your surroundings, feeling grounded and present.
Three... feeling refreshed and invigorated, carrying your newfound wisdom with you.
Four... your mind is clear, your body is energised, and you are ready to open your eyes.
And five... eyes open, wide awake, feeling absolutely wonderful, insightful, and ready to embrace your day with renewed understanding."

## Introduction

This script is designed to help individuals effectively 'future pace' their desired outcomes, mentally rehearsing success to program the subconscious mind for achievement. It aims to build confidence, clarify vision, and accelerate manifestation.

## Script

**(Induction - Progressive Relaxation)**

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. Take a deep, calming breath, and as you exhale, release any tension you might be holding. Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation.

Bring your awareness to your feet, feeling them relax and grow heavy. Let this wave of relaxation move up through your ankles, calves, and knees. Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and lower back, releasing any stiffness. Your abdomen softens, and your chest relaxes with each gentle breath.

Allow these feelings to wash over you, knowing that this future is real, it is tangible, and it is already within your grasp. Your subconscious mind is now receiving a clear blueprint for success, aligning all your inner resources to make this future a reality.
