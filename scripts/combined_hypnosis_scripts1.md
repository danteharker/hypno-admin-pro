# Progressive Relaxation Induction

## Introduction

This script is designed to gently guide the client into a state of deep physical and mental relaxation, preparing them for further therapeutic suggestions. It is a foundational induction technique that can be adapted for various sessions.

## Script

**(Pre-Talk - Optional, but recommended to set expectations and address any concerns)**

"Welcome. As we begin, I invite you to find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. Allow your body to settle, making any small adjustments you need to feel completely at ease. This time is just for you, a moment to simply relax and let go. There's nothing you need to do, nowhere you need to be, except right here, right now. Just allow yourself to be open to the experience, knowing that you are safe and supported throughout this process."

**(Induction)**

"Now, I invite you to gently close your eyes, or if you prefer, you can simply soften your gaze. Take a slow, deep breath in, filling your lungs completely, and as you exhale, imagine any tension in your body simply melting away. Breathe in peace, breathe out tension. Continue to breathe slowly and deeply, at your own comfortable pace.

Bring your awareness now to the very top of your head, to the tiny muscles in your scalp. Notice any sensations there, and with each breath out, allow those muscles to soften and relax. Feel a gentle wave of relaxation beginning to spread, moving down from your scalp, over your forehead, smoothing out any lines of worry or thought.

Allow this wave of relaxation to flow down to your eyes, feeling your eyelids grow heavy and comfortable. Let it move to your temples, your cheeks, and your jaw. Notice how your jaw might soften, perhaps your mouth parting slightly, as all the muscles in your face release any held tension. Your tongue rests gently in your mouth, completely relaxed.

This soothing wave continues its journey, flowing down into your neck and shoulders. Feel the weight of your shoulders dropping, releasing any burdens you may have been carrying. The relaxation deepens as it moves down your arms, through your elbows, forearms, wrists, and into your hands. Feel the tips of your fingers and thumbs becoming soft and loose, completely relaxed.

Now, bring your awareness to your chest. Feel the gentle rise and fall of your breath, and with each exhale, allow any tightness or constriction in your chest to dissolve. The relaxation flows into your upper back, releasing any tension along your spine. It continues down into your stomach, allowing your abdominal muscles to soften and relax completely.

Feel this wave of calm moving into your lower back, your hips, and your glutes. All the muscles in these areas are letting go, becoming heavy and deeply relaxed. The relaxation continues its journey down your thighs, through your knees, and into your calves and shins. Feel your legs becoming heavy, warm, and completely at ease.

Finally, this wave of profound relaxation reaches your ankles, your feet, and the very tips of your toes. Every muscle, every nerve, every cell in your body is now deeply relaxed, from the top of your head to the tips of your toes. You are completely at peace, drifting deeper and deeper with each passing moment."

**(Deepener - To be followed by a specific deepener script, or integrated into the induction)**

"And as you continue to relax, imagine yourself at the top of a beautiful, gentle staircase. With each step down, you will find yourself drifting even deeper into a state of profound relaxation. Ten... feeling yourself sinking deeper... Nine... letting go more and more... Eight... a wonderful sense of calm... Seven... deeper and deeper... Six... completely at ease... Five... so peaceful... Four... almost there... Three... deeply relaxed... Two... almost at the bottom... And one... completely and utterly relaxed, at the very bottom of this beautiful staircase, in a state of perfect peace."

**(Therapeutic Content - To be inserted here, tailored to the client's needs)**

**(Termination - Example)**

"Now, in a moment, I will begin to count from one to five, and with each number, you will become more and more aware, more and more alert, and more and more refreshed. When I reach the count of five, you will open your eyes, feeling wonderful, wide awake, and carrying all the positive feelings and suggestions from this session with you.

One... beginning to become aware of your surroundings.
Two... feeling a gentle energy returning to your body.
Three... feeling refreshed and invigorated.
Four... ready to open your eyes.
And five... eyes open, wide awake, feeling absolutely wonderful, refreshed, and ready to continue with your day."

# Overcoming Procrastination

## Introduction

This script is designed to help individuals overcome procrastination by fostering a sense of motivation, focus, and the ability to take action. It aims to reframe tasks and build positive associations with productivity.

## Script

**(Induction - Progressive Relaxation)**

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. Take a deep, calming breath, and as you exhale, release any tension you might be holding. Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation.

Bring your awareness to your feet, feeling them relax and grow heavy. Let this wave of relaxation move up through your ankles, calves, and knees. Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and lower back, releasing any stiffness. Your abdomen softens, and your chest relaxes with each gentle breath.

Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, through your shoulders, and down your arms to your fingertips. Your neck and jaw relax, your facial muscles soften, and your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm."

**(Deepener - The Forest Path)**

"Imagine yourself standing at the beginning of a beautiful, serene forest path. The air is fresh and clean, and the sunlight filters gently through the leaves above. With each step you take along this path, you find yourself drifting deeper into a state of profound relaxation. The path is soft beneath your feet, and with every step, you feel more peaceful, more calm, and more deeply connected to your inner resources. You walk further and further, each step taking you deeper into this tranquil state, feeling wonderfully safe and secure."

**(Therapeutic Content)**

"Now, as you rest in this peaceful state, bring to mind a task that you have been putting off, a task that you know would benefit you to complete. Notice how you might have felt about this task in the past – perhaps a sense of dread, overwhelm, or resistance. Simply observe these feelings without judgment.

And now, imagine placing that task in front of you, not as a burden, but as a small, manageable step. See it clearly, and notice that it is not as daunting as it once seemed. You have within you an incredible capacity for focus and action. Imagine a gentle, warm light beginning to glow within your chest, a light of motivation and clarity. Feel this light expanding, filling your entire being with a quiet determination.

As this light grows, you begin to see the task differently. You see the positive outcome, the sense of accomplishment, the freedom that comes with completion. Break the task down into the very first, smallest step you can take. It might be as simple as opening a document, making a phone call, or writing down a single idea. Focus on that one small step.

Feel a surge of positive energy flowing towards that first step. You are capable, you are focused, and you are ready. Imagine yourself effortlessly taking that first step, and notice the feeling of satisfaction that washes over you. This feeling of accomplishment is a powerful motivator, and you can carry it with you. Each small step leads to the next, building momentum, building confidence.

From this moment forward, you will find it easier to initiate tasks. You will recognise the subtle cues of procrastination and gently redirect your energy towards productive action. You will experience a growing sense of satisfaction and freedom as you complete what needs to be done, knowing that you are in control of your time and your energy. You are becoming a person of action, a person who embraces challenges and finds joy in accomplishment."

**(Termination)**

"Now, it is time to gently return to your full waking awareness, bringing with you all the positive changes and renewed motivation. I will count from one to five, and with each number, you will feel more and more alert, refreshed, and ready to engage with your day.

One... beginning to feel a gentle energy returning to your body.
Two... becoming more aware of your surroundings, feeling grounded and present.
Three... feeling refreshed and invigorated, ready to take on tasks with clarity and focus.
Four... your mind is clear, your body is energised, and you are ready to open your eyes.
And five... eyes open, wide awake, feeling absolutely wonderful, motivated, and ready to take positive action in your life."

Bring your awareness to your feet, feeling them relax and grow heavy. Let this wave of relaxation move up through your ankles, calves, and knees. Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose.

Imagine yourself approaching a new challenge with a sense of excitement and curiosity. You are not afraid to take calculated risks, knowing that even if the outcome is not what you initially expected, you will learn and adapt. You trust in your ability to overcome obstacles and to find creative solutions.

From this moment forward, you will find it easier to embrace challenges and to step outside of your comfort zone. You will view setbacks as temporary detours, not dead ends. Your inner critic softens, replaced by a supportive inner coach that encourages you to learn, grow, and persevere. You are becoming a person who is resilient, courageous, and unafraid to pursue your dreams.

Feel this deep sense of freedom from the fear of failure settling within you. It is a natural part of who you are, always accessible, always empowering. You are a courageous individual, and you embrace every opportunity to learn, grow, and achieve your highest potential."

Three... feeling refreshed and invigorated, carrying your newfound peace and calm with you.
Four... your mind is clear, your body is energised, and you are ready to open your eyes.
And five... eyes open, wide awake, feeling absolutely wonderful, peaceful, and ready to embrace your day with serenity."
