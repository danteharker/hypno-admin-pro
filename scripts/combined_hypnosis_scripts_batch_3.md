## Introduction

This script is designed to help individuals cultivate a strong sense of self-worth and confidence, fostering positive self-perception and inner strength. It aims to reprogram self-doubt and negative self-talk into empowering beliefs.

## Script

**(Induction - Progressive Relaxation)**

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. Take a deep, calming breath, and as you exhale, release any tension you might be holding. Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation.

Bring your awareness to your feet, feeling them relax and grow heavy. Let this wave of relaxation move up through your ankles, calves, and knees. Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and lower back, releasing any stiffness. Your abdomen softens, and your chest relaxes with each gentle breath.

Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, through your shoulders, and down your arms to your fingertips. Your neck and jaw relax, your facial muscles soften, and your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm."

**(Deepener - The Mirror of Inner Worth)**

"Imagine yourself standing before a magnificent, shimmering mirror, a 'Mirror of Inner Worth'. As you gaze into it, you don't see your physical reflection, but rather the essence of your true self – radiant, powerful, and inherently worthy. This mirror reflects your strengths, your kindness, your unique talents, and your boundless potential. With each moment you spend before this mirror, you feel a profound sense of self-acceptance and love, drawing you deeper into a state of profound self-esteem and inner peace."

**(Therapeutic Content)**

"Now, in this Mirror of Inner Worth, feel a powerful sense of self-esteem awakening within you. You recognise that you are a unique, valuable, and inherently worthy individual, deserving of all the love, respect, and happiness in the world. Any old patterns of self-doubt, self-criticism, or feelings of inadequacy simply dissolve and fade away, replaced by a profound sense of unwavering confidence and self-acceptance.

Imagine yourself moving through your day with a newfound sense of confidence. You speak your truth, you pursue your passions, and you embrace challenges as opportunities for growth. You treat yourself with kindness and compassion, just as you would a cherished friend. Your inner dialogue becomes one of encouragement, support, and unwavering belief in your own capabilities.

From this moment forward, you will find it easier to cultivate a strong and healthy self-esteem. You will instinctively recognise your worth, celebrate your uniqueness, and honour your needs. Your subconscious mind is now programmed to reinforce your inherent value, making self-esteem a natural and effortless part of your being. You are a person of immense worth, and you embrace your ability to live a life filled with confidence, joy, and authentic self-expression."

**(Termination)**

"Now, it is time to gently return to your full waking awareness, bringing with you all the positive feelings of self-esteem, confidence, and inner worth. I will count from one to five, and with each number, you will feel more and more alert, refreshed, and ready to engage with your day.

One... beginning to feel a gentle energy returning to your body.
Two... becoming more aware of your surroundings, feeling grounded and present.
Three... feeling refreshed and invigorated, carrying your newfound self-esteem with you.
