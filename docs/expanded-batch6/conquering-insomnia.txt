## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Sleep Cloud

"Imagine yourself lying on a soft, billowing cloud. The cloud cradles you gently, supporting every part of your body. (Pause 3s) Above you, the sky is a deep, starlit expanse. Stars twinkle softly. The air is cool and still. (Pause 3s) You feel yourself drifting... floating... as the cloud moves slowly through the night sky. There is no rush. No obligation. Only peace. (Pause 5s) With each breath, you sink a little deeper into the cloud. Your body becomes heavier... softer... more relaxed. (Pause 5s) The stars seem to pulse gently, in rhythm with your slowing heartbeat. Your mind grows quiet. Your thoughts drift away like wisps. (Pause 3s) You are safe here. You are supported. You are drifting naturally toward sleep. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling of floating on the sleep cloud draw you deeper. Your eyes are already closed. Your body knows how to rest. You are surrendering to the natural pull of sleep. (Pause 5s)"

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this peaceful space, recognise that your body has a natural ability to sleep. (Pause 3s) Sleep is not something you must force or fight for. It is a capacity you already possess. Your nervous system knows how to quieten. Your mind knows how to rest. (Pause 5s) Any old patterns of racing thoughts, tension at bedtime, or fear of not sleeping simply soften and fade. In their place, a calm certainty grows: you can sleep. You will sleep. (Pause 5s) Imagine your bedroom as a sanctuary. A place reserved for rest. Soft, comfortable, and inviting. (Pause 3s) When you lie down at night, your body recognises this as the signal to unwind. Your breath slows. Your muscles release. (Pause 5s) You deserve peaceful bedtimes. No screens, no urgency, no mental lists taking over. Just a gentle wind-down. A ritual that tells your mind and body: it is time to rest. (Pause 5s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to fall asleep. You will allow yourself to drift. You will trust that sleep will come. (Pause 3s) When you climb into bed, you can picture the sleep cloud. You can feel yourself floating. You can let go. (Pause 5s) Deep, restorative sleep is available to you. Your body uses this time to repair, to restore, to consolidate. You wake refreshed because you have allowed yourself to rest fully. (Pause 5s) Any belief that you are a bad sleeper, or that sleep is elusive, simply dissolves. You are reclaiming your natural ability to sleep well. (Pause 3s) See yourself tonight... getting into bed with a sense of calm. You close your eyes. You breathe. You feel the soft cloud beneath you. You drift. (Pause 5s) See yourself waking in the morning... feeling refreshed. Your mind is clear. Your body has had the rest it needed. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the weeks to come... bedtime becoming something you look forward to. A gift you give yourself. Not a battle. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your sleep. It will remind you of the sleep cloud when your mind starts to race. (Pause 5s) If you wake in the night, you can return to the image of the cloud. You can breathe. You can drift back to sleep without struggle. (Pause 5s) You deserve deep, restorative sleep. You deserve to wake refreshed and ready for your day. (Pause 3s) The sleep cloud is within you. Whenever you need to rest, you can close your eyes and feel yourself floating. (Pause 5s) Your body was designed to sleep. You are not broken. You are rediscovering what has always been there. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, bedtime is a peaceful transition. You let go of the day. You surrender to the night. You sleep deeply. (Pause 5s) When you listen to this before bed, you may drift off during or after. That is perfect. If you fall asleep, you stay asleep. If you complete the script, you carry the calm with you into the night. (Pause 5s) You recognise that rest is not laziness. It is necessity. You honour your need for sleep. (Pause 3s) The starlit sky and the soft cloud are yours. They represent safety, stillness, and the natural pull of sleep. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious will remind you: you can sleep. You have always had this ability. You are allowing it to return. (Pause 3s) So let this feeling sink in. You are calm. You are ready for rest. You trust your body to sleep. (Pause 5s) In the days to come, you will notice yourself feeling more rested. More patient. More able to face the day. (Pause 5s) Sleep nourishes you. It is not a luxury. It is the foundation of your wellbeing. (Pause 3s) Whenever anxiety or thoughts try to keep you awake, you can return to the cloud. To the stars. To the knowledge that you are safe and that sleep will come. (Pause 5s) You are becoming someone who sleeps well. Who respects the need for rest. Who wakes refreshed. (Pause 3s) The sleep cloud is yours. Use it every night. Let it carry you into deep, restorative sleep. (Pause 5s) You deserve to wake feeling wonderful. You deserve nights of peaceful, uninterrupted rest. (Pause 3s) Your mind and body will remember this experience. When you lie down, they will respond. They will relax. They will sleep. (Pause 5s) Consider the rhythm of your evenings. A consistent wind-down tells your brain that sleep is coming. Dim the lights. Put aside work and screens. Perhaps you read, or listen to gentle music, or simply breathe. (Pause 3s) Your bedroom becomes associated only with rest and intimacy. Not with worry, not with screens, not with the day's unfinished business. (Pause 5s) That association strengthens every night you use the sleep cloud. Your subconscious learns: this room, this bed, this position means sleep. (Pause 5s) Even if you have had years of poor sleep, the brain can relearn. Neuroplasticity means that new patterns can replace old ones. You are giving your mind and body a new pattern tonight. (Pause 3s) When you wake in the small hours, you need not spiral into frustration. You can simply breathe. You can picture the cloud. You can say to yourself: I am safe. I can drift again. (Pause 5s) Many people fall back to sleep when they stop fighting. When they stop checking the clock. When they return to the image of the starlit sky and the soft support beneath them. (Pause 5s) You are not broken. You are not defective. You are human, and you are giving yourself permission to rest. (Pause 3s) The more you practise this script, the stronger the association becomes. The sleep cloud becomes an instant trigger for relaxation. (Pause 5s) Waking refreshed is not luck. It is the natural result of deep, restorative sleep. Your body repairs itself at night. Your mind consolidates memories and processes the day. (Pause 3s) When you allow yourself to sleep well, you are investing in every area of your life: your mood, your concentration, your patience, your health. (Pause 5s) Some nights will still be easier than others. That is normal. What matters is that you have a resource—the sleep cloud—and a belief in your ability to sleep. (Pause 5s) You no longer need to dread bedtime. You can look forward to the soft cloud, the starlit sky, and the gentle drift into rest. (Pause 3s) Your natural ability to sleep is your birthright. Civilisation has brought screens and schedules, but your nervous system still knows how to switch off when you give it the right cues. (Pause 5s) Peaceful bedtime, a dark room, a cool temperature, and the image of the sleep cloud are those cues. (Pause 5s) Every night you drift off with the sleep cloud, you reinforce the message: I can sleep. I do sleep. I wake refreshed. (Pause 3s) Deep restorative sleep and waking refreshed are within your reach. Your natural ability to sleep is real. Trust it. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the sleep cloud. You have connected with your natural ability to sleep. (Pause 5s) If this recording is used at bedtime, you may choose to remain in this state and drift into sleep. If so, let yourself go. Sleep deeply. Wake refreshed. (Pause 3s) If you are listening at another time, you will carry this calm with you. When bedtime comes, you will remember the cloud. You will drift. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to sleep well. A calm mind. A relaxed body. The image of the sleep cloud. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, you honour your sleep. You create a peaceful bedtime. You allow yourself to rest deeply and wake refreshed. (Pause 5s) The starlit sky is within you. The soft cloud is within you. Sleep is your birthright. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support restful nights and refreshed mornings. (Pause 5s) You are not fighting sleep anymore. You are welcoming it. You are floating into it. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of peaceful sleep. The gift of the sleep cloud. (Pause 5s) You deserve to wake refreshed. You deserve nights of deep, restorative rest. The sleep cloud is yours. Use it. Trust it. You can sleep. You will sleep. You will wake refreshed. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen again, the connection deepens. Your ability to drift into sleep strengthens. (Pause 5s) You are allowing a part of yourself that has always known how to rest to take the lead. (Pause 3s) The cloud is yours. The stars are yours. The feeling of drifting into sleep is yours. (Pause 5s) So as you go back into your day, or as you drift into sleep, carry the sleep cloud with you. You have this resource now. (Pause 3s) You have the natural ability to sleep. You have the image of the cloud. You have the choice to create a peaceful bedtime and to allow deep, restorative sleep. (Pause 5s) You are a good sleeper. You wake refreshed. You deserve rest. Believe it. Live it. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious will remind you. Whenever the night comes, you can return to the cloud. To the stars. To the peace of drifting into sleep. (Pause 5s) You have taken an important step. You have connected with your ability to sleep. Let it guide you. Let it restore you. (Pause 3s) So go forward with this calm. With this trust. With the knowledge that you can sleep deeply and wake refreshed. (Pause 5s) The sleep cloud is always with you. You are ready. You can sleep. Believe it. (Pause 3s) You have the sleep cloud. You have the ability to rest. Use them well. You are at ease. Sleep will come. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious holds the image of the sleep cloud. It will remind you to breathe and drift. You can sleep. Trust yourself. You have this now. The cloud is yours. Restful sleep is your choice. From this day forward. You are ready. You will sleep well. Go in peace."

## Termination

"Now, it is time to gently return to your full waking awareness, bringing with you all the positive feelings of calm, restfulness, and your natural ability to sleep. (Pause 3s) I will count from one to five, and with each number, you will feel more and more alert, refreshed, and ready—or, if you are listening at bedtime, you may allow yourself to drift into sleep and remain asleep. If you are waking now:

One... beginning to feel a gentle energy returning to your body. You are safe and grounded.
Two... becoming more aware of your surroundings, feeling grounded and present in the room.
Three... feeling refreshed and invigorated, carrying your newfound sense of peace and readiness for restful sleep with you.
Four... your mind is clear, your body is energised, and you are ready to open your eyes.
And five... eyes open, wide awake, feeling absolutely wonderful, calm, and ready—or, if it is bedtime, eyes may stay closed as you drift into deep, restorative sleep and wake refreshed in the morning. (Pause 3s) Remember: the sleep cloud is within you. You have a natural ability to sleep. You can rest deeply and wake refreshed."
