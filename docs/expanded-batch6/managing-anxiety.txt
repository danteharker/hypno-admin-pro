## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Calm Centre

"Imagine yourself in a place of complete safety. Perhaps a quiet room with soft light, or a sheltered harbour where the water is still. (Pause 3s) This is your calm centre. Nothing can reach you here unless you allow it. (Pause 3s) The walls are strong. The space is yours. You feel grounded. You feel safe. (Pause 5s) Your breath slows. Your heart rate steadies. In this place, anxiety has no power. It is simply a pattern. Not who you are. (Pause 5s) You notice the sensation of your feet on the ground. The support beneath you. The air in your lungs. (Pause 3s) This is the calm centre. A place you can return to whenever you need. A place of safety, breath, and control. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling draw you deeper. You are safe. You are calm. You have a centre that cannot be shaken. (Pause 5s)"

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this safe space, recognise that anxiety is a pattern. Not your identity. (Pause 3s) You are not an anxious person. You are a person who sometimes experiences anxiety. And you can learn to manage it. (Pause 5s) Any old belief that anxiety defines you, or that you are powerless against it, simply softens and fades. In its place, a calm understanding grows: you can ground yourself. You can breathe. You can choose calm. (Pause 5s) Grounding becomes natural. When anxiety rises, you can feel your feet on the floor. You can notice five things you see, four you hear, three you touch. You can come back to the present moment. (Pause 3s) Your breath is your anchor. A slow breath in. A slow breath out. You do not have to fight the anxiety. You can breathe through it. (Pause 5s) You have calm control. Not the absence of feeling, but the ability to respond rather than be overwhelmed. (Pause 5s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to recognise anxiety as a pattern. You will notice it. You will not fuse with it. You will ground yourself and breathe. (Pause 3s) Resilience is already within you. You have faced difficult moments before. You can face them again, with new tools. (Pause 5s) The calm centre is always available. In a meeting. In a queue. In the middle of the night. You can return to it. You can feel your feet. You can breathe. (Pause 5s) You recognise that anxiety is often the body's alarm system. Sometimes it is helpful. Sometimes it is oversensitive. You can acknowledge the signal without being ruled by it. (Pause 3s) See yourself in a situation that used to trigger anxiety. This time, you pause. You feel your feet. You take a breath. You remember: I have a calm centre. (Pause 5s) See yourself breathing through a wave of anxiety. You do not fight it. You do not panic. You breathe. It passes. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... stronger. More resilient. Calmer. You have practised. You have a place to return to. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the calm centre. It will support grounding and breath when anxiety rises. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel calm. You deserve to know that anxiety does not define you. (Pause 5s) The calm centre is within you. Whenever you need it, you can close your eyes and see the safe place. You can feel your feet. You can breathe. (Pause 3s) You are not denying that anxiety exists. You are choosing to respond with grounding, breath, and the knowledge that you have control. (Pause 5s) From this day forward, you will approach anxiety with a new mindset. You will name it: this is anxiety. This is a pattern. I can breathe. I can ground myself. (Pause 5s) When you feel the first signs of anxiety—racing heart, tight chest, spiralling thoughts—you can pause. You can return to the calm centre. You can breathe. (Pause 3s) You recognise that emotional regulation is a skill. You are building it. Each time you ground yourself, each time you breathe through anxiety, you strengthen it. (Pause 5s) Inner peace is not the absence of difficulty. It is the ability to find a still point within difficulty. You have that still point. The calm centre. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious will support you. It will remind you that you have practised this. That you have a place of safety. (Pause 3s) So let this feeling sink in. Anxiety is a pattern. You have tools. You have the calm centre. You can breathe. You can ground yourself. (Pause 5s) In the days to come, you will notice yourself pausing when anxiety rises. You will feel your feet. You will breathe. You will remember: I am not my anxiety. (Pause 5s) You will notice yourself feeling more resilient. Not because life is easier, but because you have a way to respond. (Pause 3s) When old patterns of panic or avoidance try to return, you can return to the calm centre. To the breath. To the ground beneath your feet. (Pause 5s) You are becoming someone who can manage anxiety. Who can stay grounded. Who can choose calm. (Pause 3s) The calm centre is yours. Use it whenever you need it. Let it remind you: you are safe. You can breathe. You have control. (Pause 5s) You deserve to live without being overwhelmed by anxiety. You deserve calm and resilience. (Pause 3s) Your mind and body will remember this experience. When anxiety knocks, they will have a new reference: the calm centre, the breath, the ground. (Pause 5s) Anxiety often lives in the future: what if this happens, what if that happens. Grounding brings you back to now. (Pause 3s) Right now, in this moment, you are often safe. Your feet are on the floor. You can breathe. You can look around and name what you see. (Pause 5s) The more you practise returning to the calm centre, the faster you will be able to access it. It becomes a reflex. (Pause 5s) You do not have to explain your anxiety to anyone unless you choose to. You can simply use your tools: breath, ground, calm centre. (Pause 3s) If you need to leave a situation to breathe, that is okay. Stepping away is not weakness. It is self-care. (Pause 5s) Resilience does not mean you never struggle. It means you have a way back. You have the calm centre. You have the breath. You have the ground beneath your feet. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious will continue to absorb these suggestions. Each time you listen, the pathway to calm becomes stronger. (Pause 3s) You can use the calm centre in any situation: before a difficult conversation, before a presentation, in a crowded place, or alone in the night. (Pause 5s) The safe harbour and the calm centre are the same idea: a place inside you where you are safe, where you can breathe, where you have control. (Pause 5s) Anxiety may still visit. But it no longer has to move in. You can acknowledge it, use your tools, and return to calm. (Pause 3s) You are building resilience not by avoiding difficulty but by knowing you have a way through it. (Pause 5s) Anxiety as pattern not identity, grounding, breath, calm control, resilience: these ideas are now part of your inner toolkit. (Pause 3s) The calm centre is your refuge. Whenever the world feels overwhelming, you can return to it. You can feel your feet. You can breathe. (Pause 5s) You have trained your mind to recognise anxiety as a pattern and to access grounding, breath, and calm control. That training will stay with you. (Pause 3s) When anxiety appears, you will recognise it as a pattern, ground yourself, breathe, and return to the calm centre. You have resilience. You have calm control. (Pause 5s) The calm centre is always there. Anxiety is a pattern, not your identity. You can ground yourself, breathe, and find that place of safety and calm whenever you need it. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. Anxiety as pattern not identity, grounding, breath, calm control, and resilience are now part of how you respond to difficulty. The calm centre is your refuge. You can return to it at any time. You are safe there. You can breathe there. You have calm control. You have resilience. Anxiety does not define you; your response to it does. The calm centre is yours. Ground yourself. Breathe. You have a place of safety and calm. You can manage anxiety. Your calm centre is always available. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the calm centre. You have connected with grounding, breath, and calm control. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to manage anxiety. A calm centre. A breath. The knowledge that anxiety is a pattern, not your identity. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, you choose to ground yourself. You choose to breathe. You choose to return to the calm centre when you need it. (Pause 5s) The safe place and the calm centre are within you. They represent safety, breath, and resilience. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your grounding and your breath in the days and weeks to come. (Pause 5s) You are not trying to never feel anxious. You are building the ability to respond with calm. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of the calm centre. The gift of grounding and breath. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel calm. You deserve to know that you can manage anxiety. The calm centre is yours. Use it. Trust it. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen again, the connection will deepen. Your capacity for calm and resilience will grow. (Pause 5s) You are allowing a part of yourself that can stay grounded and calm to take the lead. (Pause 3s) The calm centre is yours. The breath is yours. The feeling of safety and control is yours. (Pause 5s) So as you go back into your day, carry the calm centre with you. When anxiety rises, remember: you have this resource. (Pause 3s) You have the ability to ground yourself. You have the breath. You have the choice to return to calm. (Pause 5s) You can manage anxiety. You have a calm centre. You are resilient. Believe it. Live it. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious will remind you. Whenever anxiety knocks, you can return to the calm centre. To the breath. To the ground beneath your feet. (Pause 5s) You have taken an important step. You have connected with the calm centre and with your ability to manage anxiety. Let it guide you. (Pause 3s) So go forward with this calm. With this resilience. With the knowledge that you can ground yourself and breathe through anxiety. (Pause 5s) Your mind has received this training. It will support you. You are ready. You can manage anxiety. Believe it. (Pause 3s) You have the calm centre. You have the breath. Use them well. You are not your anxiety. You have control. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious holds the image of the calm centre. It will remind you to ground yourself and to breathe. You have this now. The calm centre is yours. From this day forward. You are ready. Go in peace."

## Termination

"Now, it is time to gently return to your full waking awareness, bringing with you all the positive feelings of calm, safety, and resilience. (Pause 3s) I will count from one to five, and with each number, you will feel more and more alert, refreshed, and ready to engage with your day.

One... beginning to feel a gentle energy returning to your body. You are safe and grounded.
Two... becoming more aware of your surroundings, feeling grounded and present in the room.
Three... feeling refreshed and invigorated, carrying your calm centre and your ability to manage anxiety with you.
Four... your mind is clear, your body is energised, and you are ready to open your eyes.
And five... eyes open, wide awake, feeling absolutely wonderful, calm, and ready to embrace your day with grounding, breath, and resilience. (Pause 3s) Remember: the calm centre is within you. Anxiety is a pattern, not your identity. You can breathe. You can stay calm."
