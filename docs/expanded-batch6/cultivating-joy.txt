## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Joy Garden

"Imagine yourself stepping into a beautiful garden filled with light and colour. (Pause 3s) The sun is warm on your skin. Flowers bloom in every hue. The air is sweet and fresh. (Pause 3s) This is the joy garden—a place where positive emotions grow naturally. You are not here to force happiness. You are here to notice it. To appreciate it. (Pause 5s) In the centre of the garden, you notice a soft, golden light—an inner sun—that seems to glow from within you. It is your capacity for joy. It has always been there. (Pause 5s) You walk slowly through the garden. You notice small delights: the scent of a flower, the song of a bird, the feeling of grass beneath your feet. (Pause 3s) With each step, you feel a little lighter. A little more open to happiness. The joy garden is within you now. You can return whenever you wish to cultivate joy. (Pause 5s)"

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this relaxed and open state, feel a deep sense of joy awakening within you. (Pause 3s) You recognise that joy is not something that only happens to other people. It is available to you. You can seek it. You can appreciate it. You can allow it. (Pause 5s) Any old habits of overlooking the good, focusing only on problems, or dismissing small pleasures simply soften and fade. In their place, gratitude and optimism grow. (Pause 5s) Imagine yourself in an ordinary moment—perhaps a morning coffee, a walk, a conversation with a friend. See yourself pausing to notice what is good. To feel the warmth of that moment. (Pause 3s) You do not need a reason to feel joy. Joy can be a choice. A practice. A way of paying attention to the positive. (Pause 5s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to cultivate joy in all areas of your life. You will instinctively notice beauty. You will appreciate small pleasures. You will carry an attitude of gratitude. (Pause 5s) Your daily happiness will increase. Not because everything is perfect, but because you are training your mind to see and savour what is good. (Pause 3s) When you feel the old habit of focusing only on what is wrong, you can picture the joy garden. You can remember the inner sun. You can ask: what is one good thing in this moment? (Pause 5s) You are becoming a person who seeks and appreciates joy. A source of positive emotion in your own life. (Pause 3s) See yourself tomorrow... waking up and taking a moment to notice something you are grateful for. A simple pleasure. A small delight. (Pause 5s) See yourself next week... in a situation that might once have passed unnoticed. This time, you pause. You appreciate. You feel a flicker of joy. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... your days brighter because you are actively cultivating joy. You notice the good. You savour it. You carry optimism with you. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the joy garden. It will help you choose appreciation when the old habit of overlooking joy tries to return. (Pause 5s) Joy is not frivolous. It is nourishing. It improves your health. It strengthens your relationships. It makes life feel worth living. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of joy sink in. You deserve to feel happy. You deserve to notice and appreciate the good in your life. (Pause 3s) The joy garden is within you. Whenever you need to remember, you can close your eyes and see the flowers. Feel the inner sun. (Pause 5s) You deserve daily happiness. You deserve to experience positive emotions without guilt or dismissal. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, joy is something you can cultivate. You are building a life of appreciation and optimism. One moment at a time. (Pause 5s) In the morning, you can take a moment to name one thing you are grateful for. Before sleep, you can recall one good thing that happened. (Pause 5s) At work, you can notice small wins. A task completed. A kind word. A moment of progress. (Pause 3s) With family and friends, you can savour their presence. You can express appreciation. You can share joy. (Pause 5s) When life is difficult, you can still allow space for joy. Joy and difficulty can coexist. A moment of laughter does not deny the struggle. It simply honours the full range of life. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious is now aligned with joy. It will remind you of the garden. It will help you seek and appreciate the positive. (Pause 3s) Let that truth settle in. You are a person who can feel joy. You are learning to cultivate it. You have this resource now. Use it well. (Pause 3s) The joy garden is yours. The inner sun is yours. The capacity for daily happiness is yours. (Pause 3s) When you see something beautiful, you can pause to take it in. When someone is kind, you can feel the warmth. When you accomplish something, you can celebrate—even in a small way. (Pause 5s) Joy is a gift you give yourself. It does not depend on perfection. It depends on attention. On gratitude. On the choice to notice the good. (Pause 5s) You may have been told that joy is for other people. Now you know it is for you too. (Pause 3s) Every time you choose to notice and appreciate something good, you strengthen this new habit. Your subconscious is learning: I can feel joy. I can cultivate happiness. (Pause 5s) The world will still have challenges. Your job is not to ignore them. Your job is to balance them with appreciation. To allow positive emotions their place. (Pause 3s) Each time you succeed, you prove to yourself that joy is possible. That you can do this. That the joy garden is real. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the joy garden. You have connected with your capacity for joy. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body will remember. When you forget to notice the good, you can return to the garden. To the inner sun. To the question: what can I appreciate right now? (Pause 3s) You deserve to feel joy. You deserve daily happiness. The joy garden is yours. Use it. Trust it. You are a person who cultivates joy now. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen to this script again, the connection to the joy garden will deepen. Your capacity for joy will grow. (Pause 5s) You are not becoming someone else. You are allowing a part of yourself that has always had the capacity for joy to take the lead. (Pause 3s) Positive emotions are not a luxury. They are a resource. They help you cope. They help you connect. They help you thrive. (Pause 5s) The garden is yours. The inner sun is yours. The feeling of appreciation and optimism is yours. (Pause 3s) So as you go back into your day, carry the joy garden with you. When you feel the first flicker of negativity taking over, pause. Breathe. Remember the flowers. The light. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to cultivate joy. You have this experience. You have the image of the garden. You have the choice, from now on, to seek and appreciate the good. (Pause 3s) Let that truth guide you. You can feel joy. You can cultivate happiness. You can live with gratitude and optimism. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your joy in the days and weeks to come. (Pause 5s) When you are having a hard day, when you feel flat, or when you simply want to feel better, you can return to this feeling. You can remember the joy garden. (Pause 5s) You deserve to experience positive emotions. You deserve the daily happiness that comes from appreciation. (Pause 3s) The joy garden has opened something in you. That opening is permanent. You are a person who can cultivate joy. Believe it. Live it. (Pause 5s) And whenever the world tempts you to focus only on the negative, you can smile inwardly. You know another way. You know the way of the joy garden. You choose appreciation. Again and again. You choose joy. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of the joy garden. The gift of cultivating joy. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body have learned something today. They will remember. When you need to feel better, you will know how. When you need to notice the good, you will have the garden. (Pause 3s) You are building a life of appreciation and daily happiness. One joyful moment at a time. The garden is within you. The inner sun is always there. You can feel joy. You can cultivate it. You are free to choose appreciation. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, let the joy garden guide you. When you feel low, picture the flowers. When you feel flat, remember the inner sun. (Pause 5s) You have trained your mind for joy. That training will stay with you. (Pause 3s) Honour this change. Use it. You deserve to live with more positive emotion. The joy garden is yours for life. (Pause 3s) And as we bring you back to full awareness, hold on to that feeling. You are open to joy. You can appreciate. You do not have to wait for perfect circumstances to be happy. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious will remind you. Whenever you forget to notice the good, you can return to the garden. To the inner sun. To the practice of appreciation. (Pause 3s) You are a person who cultivates joy. You have connected with that truth today. Trust that. Live that. The garden is there. You can visit it anytime. You choose joy. (Pause 3s) The joy garden is part of you now. It will be there whenever you close your eyes and seek happiness. (Pause 5s) You have taken an important step. You have connected with your capacity for joy. Let it guide you. Let it brighten your days. You deserve this happiness. You have the capacity for it. The joy garden is always with you. (Pause 3s) So go forward into your day with this openness. With this appreciation. With the knowledge that you can cultivate joy. (Pause 5s) Your mind has received this training. It will support you. You are ready. You are open to joy. Believe it. (Pause 3s) You have the joy garden. You have the inner sun. Use them well. You are capable of happiness. You can appreciate the good. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious holds the image of the joy garden. It will remind you to notice and savour. You are a person who cultivates joy. Trust yourself. You have this now. The garden is yours. Joy is your practice. From this day forward. You are ready. You are open to happiness. (Pause 3s) Seeking joy does not mean ignoring difficulty. It means balancing your attention so that positive emotions have a place in your life. Gratitude and optimism are choices that become easier with practice. The inner sun is always available to warm you. (Pause 5s) Daily happiness is built from small moments of appreciation. You can notice the taste of your food, the comfort of your bed, the smile of a stranger. Each notice is a step into the joy garden. (Pause 3s) Go in peace."

One... beginning to feel a gentle energy returning to your body. You are safe and grounded.
Two... becoming more aware of your surroundings, feeling grounded and present in the room.
