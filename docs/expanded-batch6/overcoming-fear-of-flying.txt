## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Cloud Journey

"Imagine yourself floating on a soft, white cloud in a vast blue sky. The sky is clear and endless. The sun is warm and gentle. (Pause 3s) You are safe on this cloud. It holds you securely. There is no falling. Only floating. (Pause 3s) The cloud moves slowly, smoothly, through the calm blue expanse. You feel serene. You feel safe. (Pause 5s) Below you, the world looks peaceful. You are above any worry. Above any fear. (Pause 5s) The air is still. The journey is smooth. Your body is relaxed. Your mind is at peace. (Pause 3s) This is what flying can feel like. Safe. Serene. A gentle journey through the sky. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling of safety and calm draw you deeper. You are on the cloud. You are secure. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this peaceful space, recognise that flying is one of the safest ways to travel. (Pause 3s) Millions of people fly every day. Pilots are highly trained. Aircraft are designed for safety. You are in capable hands. (Pause 5s) Any old patterns of fear, dread at the airport, or anxiety about take-off simply soften and fade. In their place, a calm confidence grows: you can fly. You can feel calm. (Pause 5s) Imagine yourself at the airport. You have arrived in good time. You move through security with ease. (Pause 3s) The airport is not a place of threat. It is a place of transition. A gateway to somewhere new. You feel organised. You feel prepared. (Pause 5s) You board the plane. You find your seat. You breathe. You recognise that this is a normal, safe activity. (Pause 5s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to stay calm at the airport and on the plane. You will focus on your breath. You will focus on the fact that you are safe. (Pause 3s) The smooth ascent into the sky can feel like the cloud journey. You are rising gently. The pilots know what they are doing. (Pause 5s) If there is turbulence, you recognise it as normal. Like driving over a bump in the road. The plane is built for it. It does not mean danger. (Pause 5s) You can keep breathing. You can keep your body relaxed. Turbulence is minor. It passes. You remain safe. (Pause 3s) See yourself at the airport... calm, organised, and focused. You are not fighting the experience. You are moving through it. (Pause 5s) See yourself on the plane... seated, breathing steadily. The take-off is smooth. You feel the cloud beneath you. You feel safe. (Pause 5s) See yourself arriving at your destination... refreshed, proud of yourself. You did it. You flew. You managed your fear. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you that flying is safe. It will remind you of the cloud journey when anxiety rises. (Pause 5s) You deserve to travel by air without overwhelming fear. You deserve to feel calm and in control. (Pause 5s) The cloud journey is within you. Whenever you need to feel safe in the sky, you can close your eyes and see the blue sky, the soft cloud, the serenity. (Pause 3s) You are not denying that flying can feel strange. You are choosing to respond with calm rather than panic. (Pause 5s) From this day forward, you will approach flying with a new mindset. You will prepare. You will breathe. You will remind yourself: I am safe. This is normal. (Pause 5s) When you feel the first flicker of fear at the airport or on the plane, you can return to the cloud. To the blue sky. To the feeling of floating safely. (Pause 3s) You recognise that your body may still send signals of anxiety. You can acknowledge them without being ruled by them. You can breathe through them. (Pause 5s) Arriving at your destination refreshed and proud is your right. You are capable of this. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious will support you. It will remind you that you have practised this calm. That you have the cloud journey. (Pause 3s) So let this feeling sink in. Flying can be safe. You can be calm. You can arrive refreshed and proud. (Pause 5s) In the days before a flight, you will notice yourself feeling more prepared. You will have strategies: breathing, imagery, the memory of this relaxation. (Pause 5s) On the day of the flight, you will use them. You will stay grounded. You will stay calm. (Pause 3s) When the plane takes off, you can picture the cloud. When there is turbulence, you can breathe and remember: this is normal. I am safe. (Pause 5s) You are becoming someone who can fly with greater ease. Who can travel by air without being overwhelmed by fear. (Pause 3s) The cloud journey is yours. Use it every time you fly. Let it carry you through the experience. (Pause 5s) You deserve to see the world. You deserve to visit people you love. You deserve to fly without terror. (Pause 3s) Your mind and body will remember this experience. When you board a plane, they will have a new reference: safety, calm, the blue sky. (Pause 5s) Remember that the crew and pilots fly every day. For them, this is routine. They are trained for every scenario. The aircraft you board is maintained to the highest standards. (Pause 3s) Statistics can feel cold when you are anxious, but your subconscious can hold a simpler truth: millions of flights land safely every day. Yours can be one of them. (Pause 5s) At the airport, give yourself time. Rushing amplifies anxiety. Arrive early. Move slowly. Breathe. (Pause 5s) On the plane, use your breath. In for four counts. Hold for four. Out for four. This calms the nervous system and gives your mind something to focus on. (Pause 3s) If you are travelling with someone, you can tell them you are working on staying calm. Their presence can be part of your sense of safety. (Pause 5s) If you travel alone, you still have the cloud journey. You have this recording. You have your breath. You have the image of the blue sky and the soft, steady cloud. (Pause 5s) After you land, take a moment to acknowledge yourself. You did it. You faced your fear. You arrived refreshed and proud because you chose calm. (Pause 3s) Listen to this script in the days before your flight. The more you rehearse the cloud journey in a relaxed state, the more your subconscious will associate flying with calm. (Pause 5s) On the day of the flight, you might listen again in the morning or at the airport. You are building a bridge between the safe, relaxed state and the actual experience. (Pause 5s) The blue sky and the soft cloud are not childish. They are a powerful anchor. Your mind responds to imagery. It responds to safety. (Pause 3s) You are not erasing your fear overnight. You are building a new response: calm at the airport, calm on the plane, smooth ascent, turbulence as minor, arriving refreshed and proud. (Pause 5s) Each flight you take with greater calm is proof that you can do this. Your subconscious stores those successes. (Pause 3s) Flying as safe, calm at the airport and on the plane, smooth ascent, turbulence as minor, arriving refreshed and proud: these are the suggestions your mind will carry. (Pause 5s) You have chosen to work on this fear. That in itself is courageous. Your subconscious will now support you to feel calm and in control when you fly. (Pause 3s) At the airport you will feel calmer. On the plane you will breathe and remember the cloud journey. The smooth ascent will feel manageable. Any turbulence will feel minor. And when you land, you will feel refreshed and proud of yourself. (Pause 5s) Flying is safe. You can be calm at the airport and on the plane. The ascent can be smooth. Turbulence is minor. You will arrive refreshed and proud. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has absorbed these suggestions. When you next fly, you will have the cloud journey to return to. You will feel calmer and more in control. You deserve to travel by air with peace and to arrive refreshed and proud. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the cloud journey. You have connected with calm, safe flying. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to approach flying with greater peace. A calm mind. A relaxed body. The image of the cloud in the blue sky. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, you choose to see flying as safe. You choose to stay calm at the airport and on the plane. You choose to arrive refreshed and proud. (Pause 5s) The blue sky and the soft cloud are within you. They represent safety, serenity, and the possibility of peaceful travel. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support you on your next flight and every flight after. (Pause 5s) You are not pretending that fear does not exist. You are building a stronger response: calm, breath, and the knowledge that you are safe. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of the cloud journey. The gift of calm in the sky. (Pause 5s) You deserve to fly without overwhelming fear. You deserve to arrive refreshed and proud. The cloud journey is yours. Use it. Trust it. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen again, especially before a flight, the connection will deepen. Your sense of safety will grow. (Pause 5s) You are allowing a part of yourself that can be calm and confident to take the lead when you fly. (Pause 3s) The cloud is yours. The blue sky is yours. The feeling of safe, serene travel is yours. (Pause 5s) So as you go back into your day, carry the cloud journey with you. When you book a flight, when you pack, when you arrive at the airport, remember: you have this resource. (Pause 3s) You have the ability to stay calm. You have the image of the cloud. You have the choice to breathe and to focus on safety. (Pause 5s) You can fly. You can feel calm. You can arrive refreshed and proud. Believe it. Live it. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious will remind you. Whenever you fly, you can return to the cloud. To the blue sky. To the peace of the journey. (Pause 5s) You have taken an important step. You have connected with calm, safe flying. Let it guide you. Let it support your travels. (Pause 3s) So go forward with this calm. With this confidence. With the knowledge that you can fly with greater ease and arrive refreshed and proud. (Pause 5s) Your mind has received this training. It will support you. You are ready. You can fly calmly. Believe it. (Pause 3s) You have the cloud journey. You have the ability to stay calm. Use them well. You are at ease. Flying can be safe and serene. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious holds the image of the cloud journey. It will remind you to breathe and to focus on safety. You can fly. Trust yourself. You have this now. The cloud is yours. Calm flying is your choice. From this day forward. You are ready. Go in peace."

## Termination

"Now, it is time to gently return to your full waking awareness, bringing with you all the positive feelings of calm, safety, and confidence about flying. (Pause 3s) I will count from one to five, and with each number, you will feel more and more alert, refreshed, and ready to engage with your day.

One... beginning to feel a gentle energy returning to your body. You are safe and grounded.
Two... becoming more aware of your surroundings, feeling grounded and present in the room.
Three... feeling refreshed and invigorated, carrying your newfound calm about flying with you.
Four... your mind is clear, your body is energised, and you are ready to open your eyes.
And five... eyes open, wide awake, feeling absolutely wonderful, calm, and ready to embrace your day—and your next flight—with serenity and pride. (Pause 3s) Remember: the cloud journey is within you. Flying can be safe and calm. You can arrive refreshed and proud."
