## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Healthy Body

"Imagine yourself standing in a place of perfect balance. Perhaps a gentle meadow, or a quiet room filled with soft light. (Pause 3s) You feel your body from within. Strong. Alive. Vital. (Pause 3s) There is no judgement here. Only a sense of equilibrium. Your body knows what it needs. It knows how to move. How to rest. How to be nourished. (Pause 5s) You see yourself moving with ease—walking, stretching, breathing. Your muscles are supple. Your energy flows. (Pause 5s) In your mind's eye, you see a pair of scales in perfect balance. Not restriction on one side and excess on the other. Just balance. Nourishment. Care. (Pause 3s) This is the healthy body. Not a number. Not a shape. A feeling of vitality, balance, and respect for yourself. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling draw you deeper. You are in balance. You are capable of sustainable, healthy habits. You are worthy of feeling good in your body. (Pause 5s)"

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this balanced space, recognise that weight management is not about deprivation. (Pause 3s) It is about nourishment. About feeding your body well, moving in ways that feel good, and treating yourself with kindness. (Pause 5s) Any old patterns of restrictive dieting, guilt around food, or negative body image simply soften and fade. In their place, a calm, positive approach grows: you can eat mindfully. You can move with joy. You can respect your body. (Pause 5s) Mindful eating becomes natural. You notice when you are hungry. You notice when you are full. You eat with attention and without shame. (Pause 3s) Food is not the enemy. It is fuel and pleasure. You choose foods that nourish you. You enjoy them. You stop when you are satisfied. (Pause 5s) Movement is not punishment. It is a gift you give your body. You find ways to move that you enjoy—walking, dancing, stretching, swimming. (Pause 5s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to make choices that support your health. You will eat mindfully. You will move regularly. You will do both because they feel good, not because you are punishing yourself. (Pause 3s) Your body image shifts. You begin to see your body as capable. As worthy of care. As something to respect, not to fight. (Pause 5s) Sustainable habits are the goal. Not quick fixes. Not extremes. Small, consistent choices that you can maintain for life. (Pause 5s) You recognise that nourishment means more than food. It means rest, connection, and self-compassion. (Pause 3s) See yourself at mealtimes... pausing before you eat. Noticing the colours, the smells, the flavours. Eating slowly. Stopping when you are full. (Pause 5s) See yourself moving... not because you have to, but because it feels good. A walk in the fresh air. A stretch in the morning. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the mirror... with kinder eyes. You notice what your body can do. You appreciate its strength and its resilience. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the healthy body. It will support mindful eating and joyful movement. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel good in your body. You deserve to eat without guilt and to move without punishment. (Pause 5s) The healthy body and the balanced scales are within you. Whenever you need to remember, you can see the balance. You can feel the vitality. (Pause 3s) You are not chasing a number. You are building a way of life. Nourishment, not deprivation. (Pause 5s) From this day forward, you will approach food and movement with a new mindset. You will ask: does this nourish me? Does this feel good? (Pause 5s) When you feel the old pull toward restriction or overeating, you can pause. You can breathe. You can return to the image of balance. (Pause 3s) You recognise that your body has wisdom. It signals hunger. It signals fullness. You can learn to listen. (Pause 5s) Positive body image is a practice. You may not love every part of yourself overnight. But you can choose to respect your body. To care for it. To stop criticising it. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious will support you. It will remind you that you are building sustainable habits. That you are worthy of feeling good. (Pause 3s) So let this feeling sink in. You can eat mindfully. You can move with joy. You can have a positive relationship with your body. (Pause 5s) In the days to come, you will notice yourself pausing before you eat. Choosing foods that nourish you. Moving because it feels good. (Pause 5s) You will notice yourself speaking to your body with more kindness. Not perfect. But gentler. (Pause 3s) When old habits of guilt or restriction try to return, you can remember the healthy body. The balance. The vitality. (Pause 5s) You are becoming someone who nourishes themselves. Who moves with joy. Who respects their body. (Pause 3s) The healthy body is yours. Use it as your guide. Let it remind you: nourishment, not deprivation. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel at home in your body. You deserve sustainable habits that last a lifetime. (Pause 3s) Your mind and body will remember this experience. When you sit down to eat, when you choose to move, they will have a new reference: balance, care, vitality. (Pause 5s) Recognise that one meal does not define you. One day does not define you. It is the overall pattern that matters. (Pause 3s) If you overeat at a celebration, you can simply return to balance at the next meal. No guilt. No punishment. Just the next choice. (Pause 5s) If you miss a walk or a workout, you can move the next day. Consistency over perfection. (Pause 5s) Your body is not your enemy. It carries you through life. It deserves to be fed well, moved gently, and spoken to with kindness. (Pause 3s) When you look in the mirror, you can choose to notice what your body can do. It breathes. It walks. It digests. It heals. (Pause 5s) Sustainable habits are built one choice at a time. A glass of water. A vegetable. A ten-minute walk. These add up. (Pause 5s) You are not waiting to be thin to be worthy. You are worthy now. And you are choosing to care for yourself because you matter. (Pause 3s) The balanced scales in your mind are not about a number. They are about equilibrium: enough food, enough movement, enough rest, enough kindness. (Pause 5s) When you sit down to eat, take a breath first. Notice the food. Give your body a chance to register hunger and fullness. (Pause 3s) Eating slowly is a form of self-respect. It allows digestion to work well and allows you to stop when you are satisfied. (Pause 5s) Movement can be woven into your day: stairs instead of the lift, a short walk at lunch, stretching when you wake. It does not have to be dramatic to count. (Pause 5s) The healthy body is not a destination. It is a way of travelling. You are already on the path when you choose mindful eating, movement, and positive body image. (Pause 3s) Sustainable habits are built on repetition and self-compassion. You do not need to be perfect. You need to return again and again to balance, to nourishment, and to respect for your body. (Pause 5s) The imagery of the balanced scale and the healthy body will stay with you. Use them when you choose what to eat, when you choose to move, and when you look in the mirror. (Pause 5s) Mindful eating, movement, positive body image, sustainable habits, nourishment not deprivation: these are the foundations you are building for life. (Pause 3s) Your body deserves to be nourished and moved with kindness. The healthy body and the balanced scale are your guides. (Pause 5s) You choose nourishment over deprivation. You choose movement that feels good. You choose to see your body with kindness. Sustainable habits and positive body image are yours to build. (Pause 5s) Every time you eat mindfully or move with joy, you strengthen this new way of being. The healthy body is not a fantasy; it is a choice you make again and again. Nourishment, not deprivation. Movement with joy. Positive body image. You are building these into your life. The balanced scale and the healthy body are with you. Sustainable habits are within your reach. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the healthy body. You have connected with mindful eating, movement, and positive body image. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to build sustainable habits. A calm mind. A clear intention. The image of balance and vitality. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, you choose nourishment over deprivation. You choose movement that feels good. You choose to treat your body with respect. (Pause 5s) The balanced scales and the healthy body are within you. They represent care, sustainability, and self-respect. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your mindful eating and your movement in the days and weeks to come. (Pause 5s) You are not on a diet. You are building a way of life. One meal, one movement, one kind thought at a time. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of the healthy body. The gift of balance and nourishment. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel good. You deserve sustainable habits. The healthy body is yours. Use it. Trust it. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen again, the connection will deepen. Your capacity for mindful eating and positive body image will grow. (Pause 5s) You are allowing a part of yourself that knows how to care for your body to take the lead. (Pause 3s) The balance is yours. The vitality is yours. The feeling of nourishment and respect is yours. (Pause 5s) So as you go back into your day, carry the healthy body with you. When you eat, when you move, when you look in the mirror, remember: you have this resource. (Pause 3s) You have the ability to eat mindfully. You have the image of balance. You have the choice to nourish yourself and to move with joy. (Pause 5s) You are building a positive relationship with your body. You are creating sustainable habits. Believe it. Live it. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious will remind you. Whenever guilt or old patterns rise, you can return to the healthy body. To the balance. To nourishment, not deprivation. (Pause 5s) You have taken an important step. You have connected with mindful eating, movement, and positive body image. Let it guide you. (Pause 3s) So go forward with this balance. With this care. With the knowledge that you can nourish yourself and feel good in your body. (Pause 5s) Your mind has received this training. It will support you. You are ready. You can build sustainable habits. Believe it. (Pause 3s) You have the healthy body. You have the balance. Use them well. You are worthy of care. Nourishment is your choice. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious holds the image of the healthy body. It will remind you to eat mindfully, to move with joy, and to respect your body. You have this now. The healthy body is yours. From this day forward. You are ready. Go in peace."

## Termination

"Now, it is time to gently return to your full waking awareness, bringing with you all the positive feelings of balance, nourishment, and respect for your body. (Pause 3s) I will count from one to five, and with each number, you will feel more and more alert, refreshed, and ready to engage with your day.

One... beginning to feel a gentle energy returning to your body. You are safe and grounded.
Two... becoming more aware of your surroundings, feeling grounded and present in the room.
Three... feeling refreshed and invigorated, carrying your newfound sense of balance and the healthy body with you.
Four... your mind is clear, your body is energised, and you are ready to open your eyes.
And five... eyes open, wide awake, feeling absolutely wonderful, balanced, and ready to embrace your day with mindful eating, joyful movement, and positive body image. (Pause 3s) Remember: the healthy body is within you. Nourishment, not deprivation. Sustainable habits. You are worthy of feeling good."
