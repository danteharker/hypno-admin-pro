## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Gentle Garden of Memory

"Imagine yourself in a quiet, gentle garden. The light is soft—not harsh. The air is warm and still. (Pause 3s) This is a safe place. A place where you can be with your memories without being overwhelmed. (Pause 3s) In this garden, there are flowers that bloom in their own time. Some are in full bloom. Some are still budding. There is no rush. (Pause 5s) You notice a soft light—a gentle, loving light—that seems to fill the garden. It does not erase the shadows. It simply holds them with kindness. (Pause 5s) In this garden, grief is allowed. Sadness is allowed. So too is love. Memory. And the slow, gentle process of healing. (Pause 3s) You are not here to get over anything quickly. You are here to be held. To remember. To carry love forward in your own time. (Pause 5s) The gentle garden of memory is within you now. You can return whenever you need a safe place for your grief. (Pause 5s)"

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this safe and gentle space, allow yourself to acknowledge that grief is a natural response to loss. (Pause 3s) You are not broken because you grieve. You are human. Grief is the price of love. It is also the proof of love. (Pause 5s) This experience is not here to cure your grief. It is here to offer comfort. To offer a soft place to rest when the weight of loss feels heavy. (Pause 5s) You may have been told to move on, to get over it, to be strong. But healing does not follow a timetable. You are allowed to heal at your own pace. (Pause 3s) Imagine yourself carrying your love for what or whom you have lost. That love does not disappear. It can live on in you—in your heart, in your memories, in the way you choose to live. (Pause 5s) You do not have to let go of love to heal. You can carry it forward. You can honour the past whilst still moving gently into the future. (Pause 5s) From this moment forward, you give yourself permission to grieve when grief rises. You give yourself permission to feel moments of peace when they come. (Pause 3s) There is no right way to grieve. Some days will be harder. Some days will be lighter. Both are part of the journey. (Pause 5s) When you feel overwhelmed, you can picture the gentle garden. You can feel the soft light. You can remember that you are safe to feel what you feel. (Pause 5s) You are not alone in your grief. Many have walked this path. You are allowed to take your time. (Pause 3s) See yourself in the days to come... when a wave of sadness arrives. This time, you do not fight it. You allow it. You breathe. You know it will pass, and that it is okay that it came. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the weeks to come... finding small moments of comfort. Perhaps in a memory. Perhaps in the support of someone who cares. Perhaps in the gentle garden itself. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... carrying your love forward. Not forgetting. Not getting over. But living alongside your loss with a little more ease. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the garden when you need a safe place. It will help you be gentle with yourself. (Pause 5s) Grief is not something to be fixed. It is something to be witnessed. To be held. To be allowed. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of comfort sink in. You deserve to be gentle with yourself. You deserve to heal at your own pace. (Pause 3s) The gentle garden is within you. Whenever you need to remember, you can close your eyes and see the soft light. Feel the safe space. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel supported. You deserve to carry your love forward without pressure to move on before you are ready. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, you can return to this place whenever grief feels too heavy. You are building a relationship with your loss that is kind. That allows time. (Pause 5s) When someone tells you that you should be over it by now, you can remember: my healing has its own rhythm. I am allowed to take my time. (Pause 5s) When you feel guilty for having a good moment, you can remember: joy and grief can coexist. A moment of peace does not mean you have forgotten. (Pause 3s) With family and friends who also grieve, you can offer the same gentleness you are learning to offer yourself. You can listen. You can remember together. (Pause 5s) When the anniversary of a loss approaches, you can prepare. You can create space. You can return to the garden. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious is now aligned with self-compassion in grief. It will remind you of the garden. It will help you avoid the trap of judging your own healing. (Pause 3s) Let that truth settle in. You are allowed to grieve. You are allowed to heal slowly. You have this safe place now. Use it when you need it. (Pause 3s) The garden is yours. The soft light is yours. The permission to feel is yours. (Pause 3s) When you cry, you are not weak. You are human. When you laugh, you are not disloyal. You are alive. When you need to be alone, that is okay. When you need company, that is okay too. (Pause 5s) Grief is not a problem to be solved. It is an experience to be lived through, with as much kindness as you can offer yourself. (Pause 5s) You may have felt pressure to get over your loss. Now you can give yourself the gift of time. (Pause 3s) Every time you allow yourself to feel without judgement, you strengthen your capacity to heal. Your subconscious is learning: I can grieve and still be okay. I can carry love forward. (Pause 5s) The world will sometimes be impatient with grief. Your job is not to meet their timetable. Your job is to be gentle with yourself. (Pause 3s) Each time you return to the garden in your mind, you prove to yourself that you have a safe place. That you can cope. That healing is possible in its own time. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the gentle garden. You have connected with comfort. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body will remember. When grief feels overwhelming, you can return to the soft light. To the safe space. To the knowledge that you are allowed to heal at your own pace. (Pause 3s) You deserve to feel supported in your grief. You deserve to carry your love forward without being told to get over it. The garden is yours. Use it. Trust it. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen to this script again, the connection to the garden will deepen. Your capacity to comfort yourself will grow. (Pause 5s) You are not failing because you still grieve. You are human. You are loving. You are healing. (Pause 3s) The gentle garden of memory does not ask you to forget. It asks you to remember with kindness. To hold your loss and your love with tenderness. (Pause 5s) The garden is yours. The soft light is yours. The permission to take your time is yours. (Pause 3s) So as you go back into your day, carry the garden with you. When grief rises, you can close your eyes for a moment and see the soft light. Feel the safe space. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to cope with your grief. You have this experience. You have the image of the garden. You have the right to heal at your own pace. (Pause 3s) Let that truth guide you. You are allowed to grieve. You are allowed to heal slowly. You are allowed to carry love forward. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support you in the days and weeks to come. (Pause 5s) When you are having a hard day, when you miss someone or something deeply, or when you simply need comfort, you can return to this feeling. You can remember the gentle garden. (Pause 5s) You deserve to be met with compassion—from others and from yourself. You deserve the comfort that comes from allowing your grief. (Pause 3s) The garden has opened something in you. A place of safety. A place of acceptance. You can cope. You are coping. Believe it. (Pause 5s) And whenever the world tells you to move on before you are ready, you can return to the garden. You know your own pace. You know that healing cannot be rushed. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of the gentle garden. The gift of self-compassion in grief. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body have learned something today. They will remember. When you need a safe place, you will have the garden. When you need permission to feel, you will have it. (Pause 3s) You are building a relationship with your loss that is kind. One gentle moment at a time. The garden is within you. You can return whenever you need. You are allowed to grieve. You are allowed to heal. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, let the garden hold you. When grief is heavy, picture the soft light. When you feel alone, remember that you have this safe place. (Pause 5s) You have given yourself permission to heal at your own pace. That permission will stay with you. (Pause 3s) Honour your grief. Honour your love. You deserve to be gentle with yourself. The garden is yours for life. (Pause 3s) And as we bring you back to full awareness, hold on to that feeling. You are supported. You can cope. You do not have to get over your loss quickly. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious will remind you. Whenever grief feels too heavy, you can return to the garden. To the soft light. To the comfort of acceptance. (Pause 3s) You are allowed to grieve. You are allowed to carry love forward. You have a safe place. Trust that. (Pause 3s) The garden is part of you now. It will be there whenever you close your eyes and seek comfort. (Pause 5s) You have taken an important step. You have connected with a place of comfort for your grief. Let it hold you. Let it support your healing. You deserve this gentleness. The gentle garden of memory is always with you. (Pause 3s) So go forward into your day with this knowledge. With this comfort. With the permission to heal at your own pace. (Pause 5s) Your mind has received this training. It will support you. You are allowed to grieve. You are allowed to heal. Believe it. (Pause 3s) You have the garden. You have permission to take your time. Use them well. You are supported. You are allowed to carry love forward. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious holds the image of the gentle garden. It will remind you to be kind to yourself. You can cope with grief. You can heal. You have this now. The garden is yours. Gentleness is your right. From this day forward. You are supported. Go in peace."

## Termination

"Now, it is time to gently return to your full waking awareness, bringing with you all the comfort, safety, and permission to heal at your own pace. (Pause 3s) I will count from one to five, and with each number, you will feel more and more alert, refreshed, and ready to engage with your day.

One... beginning to feel a gentle energy returning to your body. You are safe and grounded.
Two... becoming more aware of your surroundings, feeling grounded and present in the room.
Three... feeling refreshed and comforted, carrying the gentle garden of memory with you into your day.
Four... your mind is clear, your body is energised, and you are ready to open your eyes.
