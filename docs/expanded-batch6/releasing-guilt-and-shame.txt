## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Release of Burden

"Imagine yourself standing in a quiet, peaceful space. You notice something on your shoulders—a weight you have been carrying. It may be old guilt. Old shame. The burden of past mistakes. (Pause 3s) You are not here to be judged. You are here to release. (Pause 3s) A soft, forgiving light begins to glow around you. It is warm. It is kind. It does not condemn. It simply offers release. (Pause 5s) You feel the weight on your shoulders beginning to loosen. You are not erasing the past. You are simply allowing yourself to put down what you no longer need to carry. (Pause 5s) With each breath out, the burden becomes lighter. The forgiving light fills you with a sense of acceptance. Of self-compassion. Of emotional freedom. (Pause 3s) The release of burden is within you now. The forgiving light is always available. You can return to this place whenever you need to let go of guilt and shame. (Pause 5s)"

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this relaxed and open state, feel a deep sense of self-forgiveness awakening within you. (Pause 3s) You recognise that you are human. You have made mistakes. So has everyone. Guilt and shame have served their purpose—they have taught you. Now you are allowed to release them. (Pause 5s) Any old burdens of guilt, shame, or the belief that you do not deserve peace simply soften and fade. In their place, acceptance and self-compassion grow. (Pause 5s) Imagine yourself putting down a heavy bag you have been carrying for a long time. Your shoulders relax. Your chest opens. You can breathe more freely. (Pause 3s) You do not have to forget the past. You can learn from it. But you do not have to punish yourself forever. You are allowed to release old burdens. (Pause 5s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to release guilt and shame. You will offer yourself the same compassion you might offer a friend. You will accept that you are worthy of emotional freedom. (Pause 5s) Your self-forgiveness will grow. Not because you are denying wrongs, but because you are choosing to stop carrying them as weapons against yourself. (Pause 3s) When you feel the old grip of guilt or shame, you can picture the forgiving light. You can breathe. You can remember: I am allowed to let go. I am allowed to forgive myself. (Pause 5s) You are becoming a person who can release old burdens. A person who can accept themselves. Who can live with self-compassion and emotional freedom. (Pause 3s) See yourself tomorrow... when a memory of a past mistake arises. This time, you do not spiral into shame. You acknowledge. You learn. You release. (Pause 5s) See yourself next week... in a situation that would once have triggered guilt. Instead of punishing yourself, you offer yourself kindness. You remember the forgiving light. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... lighter. Freer. Carrying less of the past. Living more in the present with acceptance and self-compassion. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the release of burden. It will help you choose self-forgiveness when the old habit of guilt or shame tries to return. (Pause 5s) Releasing guilt and shame is not the same as ignoring responsibility. It is the choice to stop suffering beyond what is necessary. To allow yourself to heal. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of release sink in. You deserve to put down old burdens. You deserve self-forgiveness. You deserve emotional freedom. (Pause 3s) The forgiving light is within you. Whenever you need to remember, you can close your eyes and feel the weight lifting. See the light. (Pause 5s) You deserve to live without the constant weight of guilt and shame. You deserve the peace that comes from self-acceptance. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, self-forgiveness is a choice you can make. You are building a life of self-compassion and emotional freedom. One release at a time. (Pause 5s) When you think of something you have done wrong, you can acknowledge it. You can make amends if needed. And you can choose to stop punishing yourself. (Pause 5s) When shame rises—the feeling that you are fundamentally flawed—you can challenge it. You are not your worst moment. You are a person who has made mistakes and who can grow. (Pause 3s) With others you have hurt, you can take responsibility without drowning in guilt. You can apologise. You can change. You can also forgive yourself. (Pause 5s) When you notice yourself returning to old guilt, you can pause. You can breathe. You can remember the release of burden. The forgiving light. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious is now aligned with self-forgiveness. It will remind you of the release. It will help you choose self-compassion when the old habit of self-punishment tries to return. (Pause 3s) Let that truth settle in. You are allowed to release guilt and shame. You are allowed to forgive yourself. You have this resource now. Use it well. (Pause 3s) The release of burden is yours. The forgiving light is yours. The emotional freedom that comes from self-acceptance is yours. (Pause 3s) When you make a new mistake, you can learn from it without adding it to an endless pile of shame. When someone else holds a grudge, you can still choose to release your own self-blame. (Pause 5s) Self-compassion is a gift you give yourself. It does not make you selfish. It makes you able to show up fully for yourself and others. (Pause 5s) You may have believed that you deserve to carry guilt and shame. Now you know that you deserve to release them. That you can forgive yourself. (Pause 3s) Every time you choose to put down the burden—to offer yourself forgiveness, to refuse to spiral into shame—you strengthen this new habit. Your subconscious is learning: I can release. I can forgive myself. I can be free. (Pause 5s) The past will still have happened. Your job is not to erase it. Your job is to stop carrying it as a permanent weight. To allow yourself to heal. (Pause 3s) Each time you succeed, you prove to yourself that release is possible. That you can do this. That the forgiving light is real. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the release of burden. You have connected with self-forgiveness. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body will remember. When guilt or shame rises, you can return to the forgiving light. To the release. To the knowledge that you are allowed to let go. (Pause 3s) You deserve to feel free. You deserve self-compassion. The release of burden is yours. Use it. Trust it. You are releasing guilt and shame now. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen to this script again, the connection to the forgiving light will deepen. Your capacity for self-forgiveness will grow. (Pause 5s) You are not becoming someone who ignores the past. You are becoming someone who learns from it and then allows themselves to be free. (Pause 3s) Acceptance does not mean approval of every past action. It means accepting that you are human. That you can grow. That you deserve peace. (Pause 5s) The release is yours. The forgiving light is yours. The feeling of emotional freedom is yours. (Pause 3s) So as you go back into your day, carry the release with you. When you feel the first flicker of guilt or shame, pause. Breathe. Remember the forgiving light. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to release guilt and shame. You have this experience. You have the image of the release. You have the choice, from now on, to forgive yourself. (Pause 3s) Let that truth guide you. You can release old burdens. You can accept yourself. You can live with self-compassion and emotional freedom. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your self-forgiveness in the days and weeks to come. (Pause 5s) When you are triggered by a memory, when you feel the weight of shame, or when you simply need to let go, you can return to this feeling. You can remember the release of burden. (Pause 5s) You deserve to live without the constant weight of guilt and shame. You deserve the emotional freedom that comes from self-forgiveness. (Pause 3s) The release has opened something in you. That opening is permanent. You are a person who can forgive yourself. Believe it. Live it. (Pause 5s) And whenever the old guilt or shame tries to return, you can picture the forgiving light. You know another way. You know the way of release. You choose self-forgiveness. Again and again. You choose freedom. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of the release of burden. The gift of self-forgiveness. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body have learned something today. They will remember. When you need to let go, you will have the release. When you need to forgive yourself, you will have the forgiving light. (Pause 3s) You are building a life of self-compassion and emotional freedom. One release at a time. The forgiving light is within you. You can return to it whenever you need. You are allowed to release. You are allowed to forgive yourself. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, let the release of burden guide you. When you feel guilty, picture the forgiving light. When you feel shame, take a breath and remember: I am allowed to let go. (Pause 5s) You have trained your mind for self-forgiveness. That training will stay with you. (Pause 3s) Honour this change. Use it. You deserve to live without the weight of old guilt and shame. The release is yours for life. (Pause 3s) And as we bring you back to full awareness, hold on to that feeling. You are lighter. You can forgive yourself. You do not have to carry old burdens forever. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious will remind you. Whenever guilt or shame rises, you can return to the release. To the forgiving light. To the peace of self-acceptance. (Pause 3s) You are releasing guilt and shame. You have connected with that truth today. Trust that. Live that. The release is there. You can put down the burden. You choose self-forgiveness. (Pause 3s) The release of burden is part of you now. It will be there whenever you close your eyes and seek emotional freedom. (Pause 5s) You have taken an important step. You have connected with self-forgiveness. Let it guide you. Let it lighten your days. You deserve this freedom. You have the right to release. The forgiving light is always with you. (Pause 3s) So go forward into your day with this lightness. With this self-compassion. With the knowledge that you can release old burdens. (Pause 5s) Your mind has received this training. It will support you. You are ready. You are worthy of self-forgiveness. Believe it. (Pause 3s) You have the release. You have the forgiving light. Use them well. You are free to let go.
