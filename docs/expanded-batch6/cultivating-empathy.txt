## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Bridge of Understanding

"Imagine yourself standing at one end of a beautiful, ancient bridge. The bridge stretches across a gentle river, connecting two shores. (Pause 3s) The wood is warm beneath your feet. The air is soft. You are safe here. (Pause 3s) You begin to walk slowly across the bridge. With each step, you feel your mind opening. You are not alone on this bridge. (Pause 5s) Halfway across, you pause. You look at the other shore. You imagine someone else standing there—someone whose life, whose feelings, whose perspective is different from your own. (Pause 5s) For a moment, you allow yourself to see through their eyes. To feel what they might feel. Not to become them, but to understand. (Pause 3s) The bridge is a place of connection. Of perspective-taking. Of compassion. (Pause 5s) You feel a gentle warmth in your chest—the warmth of empathy. The bridge of understanding is within you now. You can cross it whenever you wish to connect more deeply with another. (Pause 5s)"

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this relaxed state, feel a deep sense of empathy awakening within you. (Pause 3s) You recognise that every person has their own story, their own struggles, their own way of seeing the world. Perspective-taking becomes natural to you. (Pause 5s) Any old habits of quick judgement, defensiveness, or seeing only your own point of view simply soften and fade. In their place, curiosity and compassion grow. (Pause 5s) Imagine yourself in a situation where you might have once felt frustrated or distant from someone. Perhaps a colleague who behaves differently. Perhaps a family member who seems difficult. (Pause 3s) See yourself pausing. Taking a breath. Asking yourself: what might it be like to be in their shoes? What might they be carrying that I cannot see? (Pause 5s) You do not have to agree with everyone. But you can choose to understand. Understanding deepens connection. It reduces conflict. It allows you to respond with emotional intelligence rather than react from your own hurt or impatience. (Pause 5s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to cultivate empathy in all areas of your life. You will instinctively listen before judging. You will seek to see the world from another's perspective. (Pause 3s) Your relationships will benefit. People will feel heard and valued in your presence. You will feel less isolated, because connection grows when we truly see one another. (Pause 5s) When you feel the old urge to dismiss or criticise, you can picture the bridge. You can ask: what would it be like to stand in their shoes? (Pause 5s) You are becoming a person of genuine empathy. A source of understanding in a world that often rushes to judge. (Pause 3s) See yourself tomorrow... in a conversation that might once have left you irritated. This time, you listen. You wonder. You respond with compassion. (Pause 5s) See yourself next week... when someone shares something difficult. Instead of offering quick advice, you offer presence. You acknowledge their feelings. You let them know they are not alone. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... your connections deepening because you are willing to see from another's point of view. You give others the gift of being understood. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the bridge. It will help you choose empathy when the old habit of judgement tries to return. (Pause 5s) Empathy is not weakness. It is a strength. It builds trust. It opens doors. It allows you to navigate conflict with grace. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of empathy sink in. You have the capacity to understand. You have the capacity to connect. (Pause 3s) The bridge of understanding is within you. Whenever you need to remember, you can close your eyes and see yourself walking across it. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel connected. You deserve to give and receive the gift of being seen. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, empathy is a choice you can make. You are building a life of deeper connection. One conversation at a time. (Pause 5s) In difficult conversations, you will find yourself pausing to consider the other person's experience. You will use phrases that show you are trying to understand. You will ask questions instead of assuming. (Pause 5s) At work, you will recognise that colleagues have pressures and histories you may not see. You will communicate with respect and openness. (Pause 3s) With family and friends, you will listen with your full attention. You will remember that everyone is fighting a battle you may know nothing about. (Pause 5s) When someone hurts you, you can still set boundaries. But you can also wonder what pain might be driving their behaviour. Understanding does not mean accepting harm. It means responding with clarity and compassion. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious is now aligned with empathy. It will remind you of the bridge. It will help you step into another's shoes before you react. (Pause 3s) Let that truth settle in. You are a person who can understand. You are learning to see from multiple perspectives. You have this resource now. Use it well. (Pause 3s) The bridge is yours. It will always be there when you want to connect more deeply. You are capable of empathy. You are capable of compassion. (Pause 3s) When someone is rude, you can wonder what kind of day they are having. When someone disagrees with you, you can listen to why. When someone is quiet, you can offer space instead of pressure. (Pause 5s) Empathy is a gift you give yourself as much as others. It reduces your own frustration. It deepens your relationships. It makes you someone people trust. (Pause 5s) You may have been told that empathy matters. Now you are making it a practice. (Pause 3s) Every time you choose to understand before you judge, you strengthen this new habit. Your subconscious is learning: I can see from another's view. I can connect. (Pause 5s) The world will still have people who are hard to understand. Your job is not to fix them. Your job is to offer the gift of being heard and seen. (Pause 3s) Each time you succeed, you prove to yourself that empathy is possible. That you can do this. That the bridge of understanding is real. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the bridge. You have connected with empathy. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body will remember. When judgement rises, you can answer with a breath. With the image of the bridge. With the question: what might it be like for them? (Pause 3s) You deserve to feel this connection. You deserve to give and receive understanding. The bridge is yours. Use it. Trust it. You are an empathetic person now. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen to this script again, the connection to the bridge will deepen. Your capacity for empathy will grow. (Pause 5s) You are not becoming someone else. You are allowing a part of yourself that has always had the capacity for compassion to take the lead. (Pause 3s) Emotional intelligence includes the ability to recognise and understand the feelings of others. You are strengthening that ability now. (Pause 5s) The bridge is yours. The ability to see from another's perspective is yours. The feeling of deeper connection is yours. (Pause 3s) So as you go back into your day, carry the bridge with you. When you feel the first flicker of judgement, pause. Breathe. Remember the other shore. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to be empathetic. You have this experience. You have the image of the bridge. You have the choice, from now on, to understand before you react. (Pause 3s) Let that truth guide you. You are capable of empathy. You are capable of connection. You can stand in another's shoes when you choose to. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your empathy in the days and weeks to come. (Pause 5s) When you are in conflict, when you are confused by someone's behaviour, or when you simply want to connect more deeply, you can return to this feeling. You can remember the bridge. (Pause 5s) You deserve to have rich, meaningful connections. You deserve the peace that comes from understanding others. (Pause 3s) The bridge has opened something in you. That opening is permanent. You are an empathetic person. Believe it. Live it. (Pause 5s) And whenever the world tempts you to judge quickly, you can smile inwardly. You know another way. You know the way of the bridge. You choose empathy. Again and again. You choose connection. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of empathy. The gift of the bridge of understanding. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body have learned something today. They will remember. When you need to understand someone, you will know how. When you need to connect, you will have the bridge. (Pause 3s) You are building a life of deeper connection. One empathetic moment at a time. The bridge is within you. You can cross it whenever you wish. You understand. You connect. You are free to choose empathy. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, let the bridge guide you. When you feel distant from someone, picture the bridge. When you feel frustrated, take a breath and ask: what might it be like for them? (Pause 5s) You have trained your mind for empathy. That training will stay with you. (Pause 3s) Honour this change. Use it. You deserve to live with deeper connections. The bridge is yours for life. (Pause 3s) And as we bring you back to full awareness, hold on to that feeling. You are connected. You can understand. You do not have to stay in your own shoes alone. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious will remind you. Whenever judgement rises, you can return to the bridge. To the other shore. To the peace of understanding. (Pause 3s) You are an empathetic person. You have connected with that truth today. Trust that. Live that. The bridge is there. You can cross it. You choose empathy. (Pause 3s) The bridge is part of you now. It will be there whenever you close your eyes and seek connection. (Pause 5s) You have taken an important step. You have connected with empathy. Let it guide you. Let it deepen your relationships. You deserve this connection. You have the capacity for it. The bridge of understanding is always with you. (Pause 3s) So go forward into your day with this openness. With this empathy. With the knowledge that you can see from another's point of view. (Pause 5s) Your mind has received this training. It will support you. You are ready. You are empathetic. Believe it. (Pause 3s) You have the bridge. You have empathy. Use them well. You are connected. The other's shoes are there when you choose to step into them. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious holds the image of the bridge. It will remind you to pause and understand. You are an empathetic person. Trust yourself. You have this now. The bridge is yours. Empathy is your choice. From this day forward. You are ready. You are understanding. (Pause 3s) Perspective-taking is a skill that deepens with practice. Each time you ask yourself what another person might be feeling or thinking, you strengthen your emotional intelligence. You become someone who builds bridges rather than walls. (Pause 5s) Go in peace."

## Termination

"Now, it is time to gently return to your full waking awareness, bringing with you all the positive feelings of empathy, understanding, and connection. (Pause 3s) I will count from one to five, and with each number, you will feel more and more alert, refreshed, and ready to engage with your day.

One... beginning to feel a gentle energy returning to your body. You are safe and grounded.
Two... becoming more aware of your surroundings, feeling grounded and present in the room.
Three... feeling refreshed and invigorated, carrying your capacity for empathy with you into your day.
Four... your mind is clear, your body is energised, and you are ready to open your eyes.
And five... eyes open, wide awake, feeling absolutely wonderful, connected, and ready to embrace your day with understanding and compassion. (Pause 3s) Remember: the bridge of understanding is within you. You can see from another's point of view."
