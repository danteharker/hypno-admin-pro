## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Peaceful Clearing

"Imagine yourself stepping into a peaceful clearing. Perhaps in a forest, or beside a still pool of cool water. (Pause 3s) The clearing is open. There is space around you. No pressure. No crowding. (Pause 3s) You feel a cool, gentle breeze. It touches your skin. It cools any heat. It brings a sense of spaciousness. (Pause 5s) In this clearing, you have room to breathe. Room to think. Room to choose how you respond. (Pause 5s) Perhaps you dip your hands into the cool water. The coolness spreads. Your body relaxes. Your mind clears. (Pause 3s) This is the peaceful clearing. A place of cooling. A place of space. A place where you can pause before you react. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling draw you deeper. You have space. You have coolness. You have the ability to find peace before you speak or act. (Pause 5s)"

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this peaceful space, recognise that you can choose to pause before you react. (Pause 3s) Anger is a feeling. It does not have to become an action. You can feel the heat, and then you can breathe. You can find the peaceful clearing. (Pause 5s) Any old patterns of snapping, shouting, or saying things you regret simply soften and fade. In their place, a calm control grows: you can pause. You can breathe. You can choose your response. (Pause 5s) Constructive communication becomes natural. You express what you need without attacking. You listen. You seek to understand before you seek to be understood. (Pause 3s) You recognise that the pause is your power. Between the trigger and the response, there is a space. In that space, you can choose. (Pause 5s) Emotional regulation is a skill. You are building it. Each time you pause, each time you breathe before you react, you strengthen it. (Pause 5s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to pause before reacting. You will feel the rise of anger, and you will take a breath. You will find the peaceful clearing. The cool waters. The space. (Pause 3s) Inner peace is not the absence of frustration. It is the ability to feel frustration without being consumed by it. You can feel it. You can let it cool. You can respond with clarity. (Pause 5s) You deserve to communicate in ways that respect yourself and others. You deserve to feel in control of your reactions. (Pause 5s) The peaceful clearing is within you. Whenever you feel anger rising, you can close your eyes and see the clearing. Feel the cool breeze. Feel the space. (Pause 3s) You are not denying that you feel angry. You are choosing not to let anger dictate your behaviour. (Pause 5s) From this day forward, you will approach conflict with a new mindset. You will pause. You will breathe. You will ask yourself: what do I need to say? How can I say it without harm? (Pause 5s) When you feel the first flush of anger—the heat, the urge to snap—you can stop. You can find the peaceful clearing. You can breathe. You can choose. (Pause 3s) You recognise that constructive communication often means saying less in the moment and more when you are calm. (Pause 5s) You can take a break. You can say, I need a moment. You can return when you are ready to speak without attack. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the peaceful clearing. It will support the pause before you react. (Pause 3s) See yourself in a situation that used to trigger anger. This time, you feel the heat. You pause. You breathe. You find the clearing. You respond with calm. (Pause 5s) See yourself in a difficult conversation. You do not interrupt. You do not raise your voice. You speak clearly and respectfully. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... relationships feeling safer. Fewer regrets. More inner peace. (Pause 3s) So let this feeling sink in. You can pause. You can breathe. You can choose constructive communication. You can find the peaceful clearing. (Pause 5s) In the days to come, you will notice yourself pausing when anger rises. You will feel the coolness. You will feel the space. (Pause 5s) You will notice yourself speaking with more care. Listening with more patience. (Pause 3s) When old patterns of reactivity try to return, you can return to the peaceful clearing. To the cool waters. To the breath. (Pause 5s) You are becoming someone who can regulate your emotions. Who can pause before reacting. Who can communicate constructively. (Pause 3s) The peaceful clearing is yours. Use it whenever you feel the heat of anger. Let it remind you: I have space. I can cool down. I can choose. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel at peace. You deserve to express yourself without damaging yourself or others. (Pause 3s) Your mind and body will remember this experience. When anger rises, they will have a new reference: the peaceful clearing, the pause, the breath. (Pause 5s) Anger is often a signal. Something matters to you. Something feels unfair or threatened. You can honour that signal without letting it control your behaviour. (Pause 3s) After you have cooled down, you can still address the issue. You can say what you need to say. But you say it from the peaceful clearing, not from the heat of the moment. (Pause 5s) Constructive communication often starts with I feel rather than you always or you never. It invites dialogue instead of attack. (Pause 5s) If someone else is angry, you do not have to meet their intensity. You can stay in your clearing. You can breathe. You can respond when they have calmed down. (Pause 3s) The cool waters are always available. In your mind, you can dip your hands in. You can feel the coolness spreading. You can create space between the trigger and your response. (Pause 5s) Every time you pause and choose rather than react, you strengthen this new pattern. Your subconscious learns: I can handle this. I have the peaceful clearing. (Pause 5s) The cool waters are always there. You can imagine them anytime: cool, clear, calming. They cool the heat in your chest and your face. (Pause 3s) Inner peace is not the absence of strong feelings. It is the ability to feel them without being swept away. You can feel anger and still choose your behaviour. (Pause 5s) When you communicate constructively, you protect your relationships and your self-respect. You say what needs to be said without the poison of attack. (Pause 5s) Pause before reacting, constructive communication, emotional regulation, inner peace: these are the pillars you are building. (Pause 3s) The peaceful clearing and the cool waters are always available. In a traffic jam, in a difficult meeting, at home when someone pushes your buttons—you can find the clearing. You can breathe. You can choose. (Pause 5s) You are rewiring your response to frustration and conflict. Instead of instant reaction, you have the pause. Instead of attack, you have constructive communication. Instead of being ruled by anger, you have emotional regulation and inner peace. (Pause 5s) The peaceful clearing gives you space. The cool waters cool the heat. You pause before reacting. You communicate constructively. You choose inner peace. (Pause 3s) When anger rises, you do not have to act on it. You can step into the peaceful clearing. You can feel the cool waters. You can take a breath and choose your response with clarity and respect for yourself and others. (Pause 5s) Pause before reacting. Constructive communication. Emotional regulation. Inner peace. These are the gifts of the peaceful clearing and the cool waters. Your subconscious will remind you of them when you need them most. (Pause 5s) The peaceful clearing and the cool waters give you space and cooling. You no longer have to react in the heat of the moment. You can pause, breathe, and choose constructive communication and inner peace. Emotional regulation is your choice. The peaceful clearing is always there when you need it. Pause before reacting. Choose constructive communication. Find inner peace. The cool waters cool the heat. The peaceful clearing gives you space to choose. You can overcome anger. You choose the pause. You choose constructive communication and emotional regulation. The peaceful clearing and the cool waters support you. You have inner peace. You can pause and choose. You are in control. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back.

It will support your pause and your constructive communication in the days and weeks to come. (Pause 5s) You are not trying to never feel angry. You are building the ability to feel anger and still choose your response. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of the peaceful clearing. The gift of the pause and the cool waters. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel at peace. You deserve to communicate without regret. The peaceful clearing is yours. Use it. Trust it. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen again, the connection will deepen. Your capacity for emotional regulation and constructive communication will grow. (Pause 5s) You are allowing a part of yourself that can pause and choose to take the lead. (Pause 3s) The peaceful clearing is yours. The cool waters are yours. The feeling of space and inner peace is yours. (Pause 5s) So as you go back into your day, carry the peaceful clearing with you.

The peaceful clearing is yours. From this day forward. You are ready. Go in peace."
