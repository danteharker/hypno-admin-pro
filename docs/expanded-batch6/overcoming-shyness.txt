## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Open Door

"Imagine yourself standing in a comfortable room. Across from you is a door. It is open. Warm light streams through it. (Pause 3s) You are not being pushed. You are simply being invited. This is the door to the confident self—the part of you that can step into social ease. (Pause 3s) You walk slowly towards the door. With each step, you feel a little lighter. The self-consciousness that sometimes holds you back begins to soften. (Pause 5s) You step through the door. On the other side, you find not a stage, not a performance—but connection. Ease. The freedom to be yourself. (Pause 5s) You are not here to become someone else. You are here to allow the confident self that has always been within you to come forward. (Pause 3s) The open door is within you now. You can step through it whenever you wish to connect with others without shyness holding you back. (Pause 5s)"

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this relaxed and safe state, feel a deep sense of social confidence awakening within you. (Pause 3s) You recognise that shyness is not a fixed part of who you are. It is a pattern that can soften. That can fade. You have the right to express yourself. To connect. To be seen. (Pause 5s) Any old habits of holding back, avoiding social situations, or believing that you must perform perfectly simply dissolve and fade. In their place, ease and self-assurance grow. (Pause 5s) Imagine yourself in a situation that once would have made you shy—perhaps a gathering, a meeting, or a conversation with someone new. (Pause 3s) See yourself stepping through the open door. Not performing. Not trying to be impressive. Simply being present. Connecting. (Pause 5s) You understand that connection is not about performance. It is about presence. About listening. About allowing yourself to be seen without the need to be perfect. (Pause 5s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to overcome shyness in all areas of your life. You will instinctively step into social situations with more ease. You will express yourself more freely. (Pause 3s) Your self-consciousness will fade. Not because you become someone else, but because you allow the confident self that has always been there to take the lead. (Pause 5s) When you feel the old urge to shrink back or stay silent, you can picture the open door. You can breathe. You can remember: I am here to connect, not to perform. (Pause 5s) You are becoming a person who can step into social ease. A person who can express themselves. Who can connect. (Pause 3s) See yourself tomorrow... in a situation that would once have made you shy. This time, you step through the door. You show up. You allow yourself to be present. (Pause 5s) See yourself next week... starting a conversation. Not because you have to be the life of the party, but because you want to connect. You speak. You listen. You are at ease. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... your social confidence growing. You attend gatherings without dread. You share your thoughts. You allow others to see you. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the open door. It will help you choose connection when the old habit of shyness tries to return. (Pause 5s) Shyness is not a character flaw. It is a pattern that can change. You can learn to feel at ease. You can learn to express yourself. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of confidence sink in. You deserve to connect. You deserve to be seen. You deserve to express yourself without constant self-consciousness. (Pause 3s) The open door is within you. Whenever you need to remember, you can close your eyes and see yourself stepping through it. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel at ease in social situations. You deserve the freedom to be yourself with others. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, social confidence is something you can cultivate. You are building a life of connection, not performance. One step at a time. (Pause 5s) In conversations, you will find yourself speaking when you have something to say. Not dominating. Not performing. Simply participating. (Pause 5s) At work, you will contribute your ideas. You will ask questions. You will show up in meetings without the old weight of self-consciousness. (Pause 3s) With new people, you will introduce yourself. You will make eye contact. You will allow the conversation to flow without overthinking every word. (Pause 5s) When you feel the familiar pull of shyness, you can pause. You can breathe. You can remember: the goal is connection, not perfection. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious is now aligned with social confidence. It will remind you of the open door. It will help you step forward when the old habit of holding back tries to return. (Pause 3s) Let that truth settle in. You are a person who can connect. You are learning to express yourself. You have this resource now. Use it well. (Pause 3s) The open door is yours. The confident self is yours. The ability to step into social ease is yours. (Pause 3s) When you enter a room, you do not have to be the centre of attention. You only have to be present. When you speak, you do not have to be brilliant. You only have to be genuine. (Pause 5s) Connection is a gift you give yourself as much as others. It reduces loneliness. It opens opportunities. It allows you to be fully yourself. (Pause 5s) You may have believed that you are simply shy. Now you know that you can grow. That self-consciousness can fade. (Pause 3s) Every time you choose to step through the door—to show up, to speak, to connect—you strengthen this new habit. Your subconscious is learning: I can do this. I can be at ease. (Pause 5s) The world will still have situations that feel challenging. Your job is not to become an extrovert. Your job is to allow yourself to connect without being held back by shyness. (Pause 3s) Each time you succeed, you prove to yourself that social confidence is possible. That you can do this. That the open door is real. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the open door. You have connected with your confident self. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body will remember. When shyness rises, you can answer with a breath. With the image of the door. With the knowledge that you can step through. (Pause 3s) You deserve to feel at ease. You deserve to express yourself. The open door is yours. Use it. Trust it. You are overcoming shyness now. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen to this script again, the connection to the confident self will deepen. Your social ease will grow. (Pause 5s) You are not becoming someone else. You are allowing a part of yourself that has always had the capacity for connection to take the lead. (Pause 3s) Expressing yourself is not selfish. It is how you connect. It is how you contribute. It is how you let others know who you are. (Pause 5s) The door is yours. The confident self is yours. The feeling of social ease is yours. (Pause 3s) So as you go back into your day, carry the open door with you. When you feel the first flicker of shyness, pause. Breathe. Remember that you can step through. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to overcome shyness. You have this experience. You have the image of the door. You have the choice, from now on, to connect rather than hide. (Pause 3s) Let that truth guide you. You can be at ease. You can express yourself. You can connect without performance. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your social confidence in the days and weeks to come. (Pause 5s) When you are about to enter a social situation, when you want to speak but feel the old pull to stay silent, or when you simply want to feel more at ease, you can return to this feeling. You can remember the open door. (Pause 5s) You deserve to be seen. You deserve to connect. You deserve the freedom that comes from expressing yourself. (Pause 3s) The open door has opened something in you. That opening is permanent. You are a person who can overcome shyness. Believe it. Live it. (Pause 5s) And whenever the old self-consciousness tries to return, you can picture the door. You know another way. You know the way of the confident self. You choose connection. Again and again. You choose to step through. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of the open door. The gift of social confidence. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body have learned something today. They will remember. When you need to connect, you will know how. When you need to express yourself, you will have the door. (Pause 3s) You are building a life of connection and ease. One step through the door at a time. The confident self is within you. You can access it whenever you choose. You are at ease. You can connect. You are free to express yourself. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, let the open door guide you. When you feel shy, picture the door. When you want to hold back, take a breath and step through. (Pause 5s) You have trained your mind for social ease. That training will stay with you. (Pause 3s) Honour this change. Use it. You deserve to live without shyness holding you back. The open door is yours for life. (Pause 3s) And as we bring you back to full awareness, hold on to that feeling. You are confident. You can connect. You do not have to perform to be worthy of connection. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious will remind you. Whenever shyness rises, you can return to the door. To the confident self. To the ease of connection. (Pause 3s) You are overcoming shyness. You have connected with that truth today. Trust that. Live that. The door is there. You can step through. You choose connection. (Pause 3s) The open door is part of you now. It will be there whenever you close your eyes and seek social ease. (Pause 5s) You have taken an important step. You have connected with your confident self. Let it guide you. Let it ease your social experiences. You deserve this freedom. You have the capacity for it. The open door is always with you. (Pause 3s) So go forward into your day with this confidence. With this ease. With the knowledge that you can express yourself and connect. (Pause 5s) Your mind has received this training. It will support you. You are ready. You are capable of social ease. Believe it. (Pause 3s) You have the open door. You have the confident self. Use them well. You are at ease. You can connect. Self-consciousness is fading. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious holds the image of the open door. It will remind you to step forward. You are overcoming shyness. Trust yourself. You have this now. The door is yours. Connection is your choice. From this day forward. You are ready. You are at ease. (Pause 3s) Social confidence grows each time you choose to show up rather than hide. The confident self is not a performance; it is the freedom to be present and to express yourself without constant self-consciousness. (Pause 5s) Go in peace."
