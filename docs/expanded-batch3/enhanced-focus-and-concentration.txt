## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Laser Beam of Focus

"Imagine a single, powerful beam of light. A laser. It is narrow. It is bright. It cuts through everything that is not in its path. (Pause 3s) That beam represents your attention. Right now, in your mind's eye, you can direct it. You choose where it goes. (Pause 3s) Around the beam, the room is dim. Sounds are muffled. Distractions fade into the background. Only what you choose to focus on is illuminated. (Pause 5s) You feel your mind settling. Like the laser, your attention becomes sharp. Clear. Sustained. (Pause 5s) You can hold this beam on one task. One idea. One moment. Nothing pulls you away unless you allow it. (Pause 3s) The laser does not flicker. It does not scatter. It stays true. You can stay true to your focus. (Pause 5s) As you breathe, this sense of sharp, sustained concentration deepens. Your mental clarity grows. Your productivity becomes natural. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling draw you deeper. The laser beam of focus is within you. You can return to it whenever you need to direct your attention and filter out distraction."

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this relaxed state, your mind is open to new ways of directing your attention and sustaining your concentration. (Pause 3s) You recognise that focus is a skill. You can train it. You can choose where to aim your attention and you can filter out distractions. (Pause 5s) Any old patterns of scattered thinking, constant distraction, or difficulty staying on task simply fade away. In their place, a calm, clear, sustained focus grows. (Pause 5s) Imagine yourself sitting down to an important task. You take one deep breath. You bring the laser beam of focus to bear. (Pause 3s) Everything else softens. Notifications, noises, wandering thoughts—they drift to the edges. The centre of your awareness is the task. (Pause 5s) You understand that sustained concentration is possible. You do not need to fight distraction every second. You can gently return your attention again and again. Each return strengthens your focus. (Pause 5s) Your mind is capable of deep work. When you give it a single point of attention, it responds with clarity. Productivity flows from this clarity. (Pause 3s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to direct your attention and maintain mental clarity. You will instinctively filter out what does not matter in the moment. You will enter a state of flow more readily. (Pause 3s) Your productivity will feel natural. Not forced. You will work with clarity and purpose. (Pause 5s) When your mind wanders, you can simply notice, and bring the laser beam back. No criticism. No drama. Just a gentle return to focus. (Pause 5s) You are becoming someone who can concentrate deeply and work with sustained attention. (Pause 3s) See yourself tomorrow... starting a task and holding your focus for longer than before. Distractions arise; you acknowledge them and return. (Pause 5s) See yourself next week... completing important work with fewer interruptions. Your mind feels clear. Your output increases. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... known for your ability to concentrate. You get things done. You think clearly. You are productive without burning out. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the laser beam. It will help you direct your attention when distraction calls. (Pause 5s) Focus is not about never being distracted. It is about returning. Again and again. Until sustained concentration becomes your norm. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of mental clarity and concentration sink in. You have the ability to direct your attention. You have the ability to filter distractions. You have the ability to sustain focus. (Pause 3s) The laser beam is within you. Whenever you need to concentrate, you can close your eyes for a moment and see it. (Pause 5s) You deserve to work with clarity. You deserve to be productive without constant mental noise. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, directed attention is your default when you choose it. You can focus. You can sustain. You can filter. (Pause 5s) Trust that you can concentrate. Trust that distractions will fade when you give them no energy. Trust that your mind can be clear. (Pause 5s) In your work, you will single-task when it matters. You will create focus blocks. You will protect your focus time and recognise that one task at a time yields better results. You will notice when you are scattered and gently return. (Pause 5s) In your study or your projects, you will direct the laser beam. You will hold it on one thing. You will feel the satisfaction of deep work. (Pause 3s) When noise or interruption arises, you will not be thrown. You will acknowledge it, let it go, and bring your attention back. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious is now aligned with focus. It will remind you of the laser beam. It will help you choose concentration over distraction. (Pause 3s) Let that truth settle in. You can direct your attention. You can filter distractions. You can sustain concentration. You have mental clarity. (Pause 3s) The laser beam is yours. It will never judge you. It will always be available when you choose to use it. Your attention is a precious resource you can direct with intention. (Pause 3s) When you feel scattered, you can return to the image of the laser. When you feel overwhelmed by noise, you can narrow your focus to one thing. When you need to be productive, you can invoke sustained concentration. (Pause 5s) Focus is a gift you give yourself. It saves time. It improves quality. It creates a sense of accomplishment. (Pause 5s) You may have struggled with concentration before. Now you are building a new habit: direct, sustain, filter, return. (Pause 3s) Every time you bring your attention back, you strengthen this habit. Your subconscious is learning: I can focus. I can concentrate. I can filter distractions. (Pause 5s) The world will still be full of distractions. But you no longer have to be at their mercy. You can choose where to aim your attention. (Pause 3s) Some tasks will still be boring. Some days will still be noisy. Your job is not to control the world. Your job is to control your focus. (Pause 5s) Each time you sustain concentration, you prove to yourself that focus is possible. That you can do this. That your mind can be clear. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the laser beam. You have connected with focus and clarity. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body will remember. When distraction knocks, you can answer with the laser beam. With a breath. With a gentle return to the task. (Pause 3s) You deserve to work with clarity. You deserve to be productive without constant mental chatter. The laser beam is yours. Use it. Trust it. You are someone who can focus now. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen to this script again, the connection to the laser beam will deepen. Your capacity for sustained concentration will grow. (Pause 5s) You are not becoming someone else. You are allowing the part of you that has always had the capacity for deep focus to take the lead. (Pause 3s) Concentration is a trainable skill. You are now building a practice of directing attention, filtering distraction, and sustaining focus. (Pause 5s) The more you practise, the stronger your focus becomes. Your brain learns to stay with one task. It learns to ignore irrelevant stimuli. It learns that you value concentration. (Pause 3s) The laser beam is yours. The clarity is yours. The ability to concentrate is yours. (Pause 3s) So as you go back into your day, carry the laser beam with you. When you need to focus, pause. Breathe. Direct your attention. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to concentrate. You have this experience. You have the image of the laser beam. You have the choice, from now on, to focus when it matters. (Pause 3s) Let that truth guide you. You direct your attention. You filter distractions. You sustain concentration. You have mental clarity. You are productive. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your focus in the days and weeks to come. (Pause 5s) When you are faced with a demanding task or a noisy environment, you can return to this feeling. You can remember that the laser beam is within you. (Pause 5s) You deserve to work with clarity. You deserve the satisfaction of deep, focused work. (Pause 3s) The laser beam has opened something in you. That opening is permanent. You are someone who can concentrate. Believe it. Live it. (Pause 5s) And whenever distraction pulls at you, you can smile inwardly. You know another way. You know the way of the laser beam. You choose focus. Again and again. You choose clarity. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of focus. The gift of the laser beam. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body have learned something today. They will remember. When you need to concentrate, you will know how. When you need to filter distractions, you will do it. (Pause 3s) You are building a life of clarity and productivity. One focused moment at a time. The laser beam is within you. Your attention is yours to direct. You can focus. You can sustain. You are clear. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, let the laser beam guide you. When you feel scattered, picture the beam. When you feel distracted, take a breath and return. (Pause 5s) You have trained your mind for focus. That training will stay with you. (Pause 3s) Honour this change. Use it. You deserve to work with mental clarity. The laser beam is yours for life. (Pause 3s) And as we bring you back to full awareness, hold on to that feeling. You can focus. You can concentrate. You can filter distractions. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious will remind you. Whenever your mind scatters, you can return to the laser beam. To directed attention. To sustained concentration. (Pause 3s) You are someone who can focus. You have connected with that today. Trust that. Live that. You have the laser beam. You have clarity. You choose focus. (Pause 3s) The laser beam is part of you now. It will be there whenever you need to concentrate. (Pause 5s) You have taken an important step. You have connected with focus and concentration. Let it guide you. Let it improve your work and your clarity. You deserve this. You have earned it. The laser beam is always with you. (Pause 3s) So go forward into your day with this clarity. With this focus. With the knowledge that you can direct your attention and sustain your concentration. (Pause 5s) Your mind has received this training. It will support you. You are ready. You can focus. Believe it. (Pause 3s) You have the laser beam. You have focus and clarity. Use them well. You are concentrated. You are clear. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious holds the image of the laser beam. It will remind you to direct your attention and filter distractions. You can concentrate. Trust yourself. You have this now. The laser beam is yours. Focus is your choice. From this day forward. You are ready. You can focus. Go with clarity."

## Termination

"Now, it is time to gently return to your full waking awareness, bringing with you all the positive feelings of focus, concentration, and mental clarity. (Pause 3s) I will count from one to five, and with each number, you will feel more and more alert, refreshed, and ready to engage with your day.

One... beginning to feel a gentle energy returning to your body. You are safe and grounded.
Two... becoming more aware of your surroundings, feeling grounded and present in the room.
Three... feeling refreshed and invigorated, carrying your sharp focus and clarity with you into your day.
Four... your mind is clear, your body is energised, and you are ready to open your eyes.
And five... eyes open, wide awake, feeling absolutely wonderful, focused, and ready to concentrate on what matters. (Pause 3s) Remember: the laser beam of focus is within you. You can direct your attention and sustain your concentration."
