## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Vision Board of Success

"Imagine yourself standing in a quiet, well-lit room. In front of you is a large vision board, glowing with clarity and possibility. (Pause 3s) Each image and word on the board represents a goal that matters to you. They are not vague wishes. They are clear, vivid pictures of what you want to achieve. (Pause 3s) You step closer. You see your goals organised into steps. The first step is bright and achievable. The next step follows naturally. Each milestone is marked. Each obstacle has a path around it. (Pause 5s) The board shows you not only the destination but the journey. You feel a surge of motivation. This is your map. This is your plan. (Pause 5s) You notice a sense of alignment. Your goals match your values. Your actions match your intentions. (Pause 3s) As you breathe, the images seem to soften and merge with your inner vision. The vision board is no longer outside you. It is inside you. A clear, guiding picture of success. (Pause 5s) You can return to this board whenever you need to clarify your direction, celebrate a milestone, or remember why you started. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling of clarity and motivation draw you deeper. You know where you are going. You know how to get there. You are ready."

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this relaxed state, your mind is open to new ways of thinking about your goals and your achievements. (Pause 3s) You recognise that clarity is the first step to success. When your goals are clear, your mind can focus. When your goals are broken into steps, you are never overwhelmed. (Pause 5s) Any old patterns of vague wishing, procrastination, or giving up at the first obstacle simply fade away. In their place, a strong sense of purpose and direction grows. (Pause 5s) Imagine yourself looking at a goal that matters to you. See it clearly. Write it down in your mind. Break it into the smallest possible steps. (Pause 3s) The first step is something you could do today. The next step follows logically. Each step is achievable. Each step builds confidence. (Pause 5s) You understand that big achievements are built from small, consistent actions. You celebrate every milestone. You acknowledge every step forward. You do not wait until the end to feel proud. (Pause 5s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to set clear goals and take aligned action. You will instinctively break large goals into manageable steps. You will recognise obstacles as temporary and solvable. (Pause 3s) Your motivation will come from within. You will feel drawn toward your goals rather than pushed by guilt or fear. (Pause 5s) When you feel stuck, you can return to your vision. You can ask yourself: what is the very next step? You can take that step and then the next. (Pause 5s) You are becoming someone who sets goals with clarity and achieves them with consistency. (Pause 3s) See yourself tomorrow... writing down or reviewing one clear goal. Breaking it into steps. Choosing the first action. (Pause 5s) See yourself next week... having completed several small steps. Celebrating your progress. Adjusting your plan if needed. Moving forward with confidence. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... looking back at milestones you have passed. Obstacles you have overcome. Goals you have achieved or are well on your way to achieving. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of your vision board. It will help you stay motivated when the path feels long. (Pause 5s) Goal-setting is not about perfection. It is about direction. It is about knowing where you want to go and taking one step at a time. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of clarity and motivation sink in. You have the ability to clarify your goals. You have the ability to break them into steps. You have the ability to celebrate milestones and overcome obstacles. (Pause 3s) The vision board is within you. Whenever you need to remember your direction, you can close your eyes and see it. (Pause 5s) You deserve to achieve what matters to you. You deserve to feel the satisfaction of progress. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, aligned action is your default. You move toward your goals with intention. One step at a time. (Pause 5s) Trust that you can achieve what you set out to do. Trust that obstacles are part of the journey. Trust that every step counts. (Pause 5s) In your work, you will set clear objectives. You will break projects into tasks. You will acknowledge progress and adjust when necessary. (Pause 5s) In your personal life, you will identify what you want. You will take small, consistent actions. You will celebrate your wins. (Pause 3s) When an obstacle appears, you will not give up. You will look for the next step. You will ask for help if needed. You will keep going. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious is now aligned with achievement. It will remind you of your vision. It will help you choose the next action. It will support your motivation. (Pause 3s) Let that truth settle in. You are a goal-setter. You are an achiever. You break goals into steps. You celebrate milestones. You overcome obstacles. (Pause 3s) The vision board is yours. It will never judge you. It will always show you the way. You have this resource now. Use it well. (Pause 3s) When you feel unmotivated, you can return to your vision. When you feel overwhelmed, you can focus on the next step only. When you achieve a milestone, you can pause and celebrate. (Pause 5s) Goal-setting is a gift you give yourself. It gives you direction. It gives you a sense of progress. It makes your life more meaningful. (Pause 5s) You may have set goals before and lost steam. Now you are building a new habit: clarity, steps, celebration, and persistence. (Pause 3s) Every time you take a small step, you strengthen this habit. Your subconscious is learning: I can achieve. I can progress. I can overcome obstacles. (Pause 5s) The path to any goal is rarely straight. But you no longer need it to be. You can adjust. You can keep moving. (Pause 3s) Some goals will take longer than expected. Some steps will feel hard. Your job is not to be perfect. Your job is to stay aligned and keep going. (Pause 5s) Each time you complete a step or celebrate a milestone, you prove to yourself that achievement is possible. That you can do this. That your vision is real. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with your vision board. You have connected with clarity and motivation. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body will remember. When doubt or overwhelm knocks, you can answer with the next step. With the image of your vision. With the knowledge that you are capable. (Pause 3s) You deserve to achieve your goals. You deserve to feel the satisfaction of aligned action. The vision board is yours. Use it. Trust it. You are a goal-achiever now. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen to this script again, the connection to your vision will deepen. Your ability to clarify goals and take action will grow. (Pause 5s) You are not becoming someone else. You are allowing the part of you that has always had the capacity for achievement to take the lead. (Pause 3s) Goals give life structure and meaning. You are now building a practice of clear goals, clear steps, and steady progress. (Pause 5s) The vision board is yours. The clarity is yours. The motivation to take aligned action is yours. (Pause 3s) So as you go back into your day, carry your vision with you. When you feel lost, pause. Look at your goals. Choose the next step. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to achieve what matters to you. You have this experience. You have the image of the vision board. You have the choice, from now on, to act with clarity and purpose. (Pause 3s) Let that truth guide you. You set clear goals. You break them into steps. You celebrate milestones. You overcome obstacles. You take aligned action. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your goal-setting and achievement in the days and weeks to come. (Pause 5s) When you are faced with a big dream or a long project, you can return to this feeling. You can remember that every big achievement is a series of small steps. (Pause 5s) You deserve to move toward what you want. You deserve the satisfaction of progress and the joy of milestones. (Pause 3s) The vision board has opened something in you. That opening is permanent. You are a person who sets goals and achieves them. Believe it. Live it. (Pause 5s) And whenever the path feels long, you can smile inwardly. You know another way. You know the way of the vision board. You choose the next step. Again and again. You choose progress. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of clarity. The gift of the vision board.

(Pause 3s) You are building a life of direction and achievement. One step at a time. The vision board is within you. Your goals are clear. You have the motivation. You have the method. You are capable. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, let the vision board guide you. When you feel unclear, picture your goals. When you feel stuck, break it down. (Pause 5s) You have trained your mind for goal-setting and achievement. That training will stay with you. (Pause 3s) Honour this change. Use it. You deserve to move toward what you want. The vision board is yours for life. (Pause 3s) And as we bring you back to full awareness, hold on to that feeling. You have clarity. You have a plan. You can achieve your goals.
