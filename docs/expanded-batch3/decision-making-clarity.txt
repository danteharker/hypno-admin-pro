## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Crossroads of Choice

"Imagine yourself standing at a peaceful crossroads. The paths ahead are clear. The light is soft. There is no rush. (Pause 3s) You are not lost. You are at a place of choice. Each path represents an option. You have the time and the clarity to consider them. (Pause 3s) You feel a calm certainty growing. Deep inside you, there is wisdom. An inner knowing that can guide you. (Pause 5s) You weigh the options without panic. You notice what your body tells you. You notice what your intuition whispers. (Pause 5s) The crossroads is a place of power. You are not stuck. You are choosing. (Pause 3s) As you breathe, the right path becomes clearer. Not because someone told you. Because you have connected with your own inner wisdom. (Pause 5s) You can trust your choices. You can move forward with confidence. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling of clarity and trust draw you deeper. The crossroads is within you. You can return to it whenever you need to make a decision with confidence."

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this relaxed state, your mind is open to new ways of making decisions and trusting your inner wisdom. (Pause 3s) You recognise that every decision is a crossroads.

(Pause 5s) Clarity in decision-making is a gift you give yourself. It reduces anxiety. It frees your energy. It allows you to move forward. (Pause 5s) You may have struggled with decisions before. Now you are building a new habit: pause, weigh, listen, trust, choose. (Pause 3s) Every time you make a decision with clarity, you strengthen this habit. Your subconscious is learning: I can choose. I have wisdom. I can trust myself. (Pause 5s) Not every decision will be easy. But you no longer have to be paralysed. You can weigh. You can listen. You can choose.
