## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Mind Library

"Imagine a beautiful, quiet library inside your mind. The shelves are well organised. The lighting is soft. Every book, every file, every memory has its place. (Pause 3s) You walk along the aisles. You know that everything you have ever learned, every name, every date, every fact, is stored here. Nothing is lost. (Pause 3s) You reach for a volume. It opens easily. The information is clear. You can read it. You can recall it. (Pause 5s) Your mind is not cluttered. It is organised. When you need to remember something, you know where to look. (Pause 5s) You feel a sense of mental sharpness. Your recall is smooth. Your confidence in your memory grows. (Pause 3s) As you breathe, this library becomes more accessible. Names, dates, facts—they come to you when you need them. (Pause 5s) You can return to this library whenever you need to access stored information or strengthen your recall. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling draw you deeper. The mind library is within you. Your memories are safe. Your recall is ready."

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this relaxed state, your mind is open to new ways of accessing and trusting your memory. (Pause 3s) You recognise that your brain has stored vast amounts of information. You can access it. You can recall names, dates, facts, and experiences with greater ease. (Pause 5s) Any old patterns of forgetfulness, mental fogginess, or lack of confidence in your memory simply fade away. In their place, a calm mental sharpness and trust in your recall grow. (Pause 5s) Imagine yourself in a situation where you need to remember something. A name. A number. A detail from a meeting or a conversation. (Pause 3s) You pause. You breathe. You allow your mind to access the mind library. The information surfaces. Clear. Available. (Pause 5s) You understand that recall is a skill. You can improve it. You can trust that what you have learned and experienced is stored. You can retrieve it. (Pause 5s) Names, dates, and facts are not lost. They are filed in your mind library. With calm and a moment of focus, you can access them. Mental sharpness is your natural state when you trust your memory. (Pause 3s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to access stored information and recall with ease. You will feel greater mental sharpness. You will trust your memory more. (Pause 3s) Names, dates, and facts will come to you when you need them. You will not panic when asked to remember. You will breathe and allow. (Pause 5s) When you feel that a memory is out of reach, you can return to the mind library. You can relax. You can give your mind a moment. The information will often surface. (Pause 5s) You are becoming someone with confident, reliable recall. (Pause 3s) See yourself tomorrow... needing to remember someone's name. You pause. You access the mind library. The name comes. You feel confident. (Pause 5s) See yourself next week... in a meeting or a conversation. You recall details. Facts. Dates. You speak with assurance. Your mental sharpness is noticeable. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... known for your reliable memory. You remember what matters. You feel sharp. You trust your mind. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the mind library. It will support your recall when you need it. (Pause 5s) Memory is not about never forgetting. It is about knowing that information is stored and that you can access it with calm and focus. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of mental sharpness and confidence in your memory sink in. You have stored countless facts and experiences. You can access them. You can recall with ease. (Pause 3s) The mind library is within you. Whenever you need to remember, you can close your eyes for a moment and see it. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel confident in your memory. You deserve to experience mental sharpness. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, confident recall is your default when you allow it. You breathe. You access. You remember. (Pause 5s) Trust that your mind has stored what you need.

You will speak with confidence. (Pause 5s) In your personal life, you will remember important dates and conversations. You will feel mentally sharp. You will trust your recall. (Pause 3s) When you cannot remember something immediately, you will not panic. You will relax. You will give your mind time. Often the information will appear.

You can access stored information. You can recall with ease. You have mental sharpness. You have confidence in your memory. (Pause 3s) The mind library is yours. It will never lose your files. It will always be there when you need to remember. (Pause 3s) When you need to recall a name, you can visualise the mind library. When you need a date or a fact, you can breathe and allow the information to surface. When you want to strengthen your memory, you can return to this feeling. (Pause 5s) Confident recall is a gift you give yourself. It reduces anxiety. It improves performance. It builds self-assurance. (Pause 5s) You may have doubted your memory before. Now you are building a new habit: calm access, trust, and ease of recall. (Pause 3s) Every time you remember something with ease, you strengthen this habit. Your subconscious is learning: I can recall. I have access. My memory serves me. (Pause 5s) Not every detail will surface instantly. But you no longer need to fear forgetfulness. You can relax. You can allow. You can trust. (Pause 3s) Some names or facts may take a moment. Your job is not to force. Your job is to create the conditions for recall: calm, focus, and trust. (Pause 5s) Each time you recall successfully, you prove to yourself that your memory works. That you can access stored information. That you have mental sharpness.

Your ease of recall will grow. (Pause 5s) You are not becoming someone else. You are allowing the part of you that has always had the capacity for clear recall to take the lead. (Pause 3s) Your brain has stored everything you have learned. You are now building a practice of accessing that store with calm and confidence. (Pause 5s) The more you trust your memory, the more readily recall comes. Anxiety about forgetting actually interferes with recall. Calm and trust allow the mind library to open. (Pause 3s) The mind library is yours. The mental sharpness is yours. The confidence in your memory is yours. (Pause 3s) So as you go back into your day, carry the mind library with you. When you need to remember, pause. Breathe. Access. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need for confident recall. You have this experience. You have the image of the mind library.
