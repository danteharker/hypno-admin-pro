## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Inner Arena

"Imagine yourself stepping into a private arena. Not a stadium full of noise. A quiet, inner space where you perform at your best. (Pause 3s) The arena is yours. No one else is here. This is where you meet your own standards. Where you focus. Where you excel. (Pause 3s) You feel a surge of confidence. You have trained. You have prepared. You are ready to perform. (Pause 5s) In this arena, distractions fall away. Your mind is clear. Your body is ready. You are resilient. You can bounce back from any setback. (Pause 5s) You sense mastery. Not perfection. The kind of mastery that comes from practice, focus, and the willingness to keep going. (Pause 3s) As you breathe, this peak-performance state deepens. You are performing at your best. You are confident. You are focused. You are resilient. (Pause 5s) You can return to this inner arena whenever you need to access your peak-performance mindset. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling draw you deeper. The inner arena is within you. High achievement is your natural state when you choose it."
