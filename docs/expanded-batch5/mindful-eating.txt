## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Sensory Feast

"Imagine yourself in a serene space. Perhaps a quiet room with soft light, or a peaceful spot in nature. The air is calm. You feel completely at ease. (Pause 3s) In front of you is a single piece of food. It might be a piece of fruit, a small square of dark chocolate, or a slice of fresh bread. (Pause 3s) Notice its colours. The way light touches its surface. The subtle variations in hue and shade. (Pause 5s) Observe its shape. Its curves or edges. The way it rests in your palm or on the plate. (Pause 3s) Bring it slowly to your nose. Inhale its aroma. Sweet, earthy, fresh, or rich. Let the scent fill your awareness. (Pause 5s) Notice the texture beneath your fingers or against your lips. Smooth, rough, soft, or crisp. (Pause 3s) When you are ready, take one small bite. Let it rest on your tongue. Notice the flavours unfolding. The way your mouth responds. (Pause 5s) There is no rush. No distraction. Just you and this moment of mindful appreciation. (Pause 3s) As you savour this sensory feast, you feel a deep sense of presence and gratitude. Your body knows how to eat with intention. (Pause 5s) This feeling draws you deeper into relaxation. The sensory feast is within you now. You can return to it whenever you sit down to eat."

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this calm and relaxed state, your relationship with food is gently transforming. (Pause 3s) You recognise that eating can be an act of nourishment and pleasure, not restriction or guilt. (Pause 5s) Old patterns of rushing, distraction, or eating without awareness simply soften and fade. In their place, a natural desire to eat with intention grows. (Pause 5s) You will find yourself drawn to savouring each mouthful. Noticing the colours, textures, and flavours of your food. (Pause 3s) Your body has wisdom. It sends signals of hunger and fullness. You are learning to listen. To pause before eating and ask: am I truly hungry? What does my body need? (Pause 5s) When you eat, you eat. You put aside screens and distractions. You give your meal your full attention. (Pause 5s) You discover that satisfaction comes not from quantity but from presence. From truly tasting. From allowing yourself to enjoy. (Pause 3s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to eat with intention. You will naturally slow down. You will notice when you are full and honour that signal. (Pause 5s) Food is not the enemy. It is fuel and joy. Nourishment and pleasure. You deserve to eat without shame. (Pause 3s) When you feel the old urge to eat quickly or mindlessly, you can picture the sensory feast. You can take one breath. You can bring your awareness to the food in front of you. (Pause 5s) You are becoming someone who eats with mindfulness. Who savours. Who listens to their body. (Pause 3s) See yourself tomorrow... sitting down to a meal. You pause. You look at your plate. You take the first bite with full attention. (Pause 5s) See yourself next week... noticing hunger and fullness more clearly. Choosing to stop when you are satisfied, not when the plate is empty. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... your relationship with food feeling calm and positive. No more guilt. No more rushing. Just gentle, intentional eating. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the sensory feast. It will help you slow down and savour when the old habit of mindless eating tries to return. (Pause 5s) Eating with intention is a gift you give yourself. It supports digestion. It increases satisfaction. It reduces the urge to overeat. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of mindful eating sink in. You have the capacity to eat with awareness. To enjoy your food fully. To honour your body's signals. (Pause 3s) The serene space and the single piece of food are within you. Whenever you sit down to eat, you can return to this feeling. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel satisfied. You deserve to eat without guilt or rush. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, eating with intention is your default. You are building a relationship with food based on nourishment and joy. One meal at a time. (Pause 5s) Trust your body. Trust that when you listen, it will guide you. And in the meantime, you can eat with presence. With savouring. With the knowledge that you are nourishing yourself well. (Pause 5s) At breakfast, you will take time to taste your first bite. At lunch, you will put aside distractions and focus on your meal. (Pause 3s) At dinner, you will notice the colours and aromas. You will chew slowly. You will pause between mouthfuls. (Pause 5s) When you snack, you will choose to be present. One piece at a time. Fully tasted. (Pause 5s) When you feel full, you will honour that signal. You will stop. You will feel proud of listening to your body. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious is now aligned with mindful eating. It will remind you of the sensory feast. It will remind you to breathe and notice. It will help you choose presence over distraction. (Pause 5s) Let that truth settle in. You eat with intention. You savour. You listen to your body. You have this resource now. Use it well. (Pause 3s) The sensory feast is yours. It will never judge. It will always remind you: you can eat with awareness. You can enjoy. You are nourished. (Pause 3s) When you are tempted to eat on the run, you can pause and take one mindful bite. When you feel the old guilt about food, you can remember that nourishment is kind. When you sit down to a meal, you can give it your full attention. (Pause 5s) Mindful eating is a gift you give yourself. It calms your nervous system. It increases satisfaction. It helps you feel at peace with food. (Pause 5s) You may have struggled with your relationship with food in the past. Now you are building a new pattern. One of intention, savouring, and body wisdom. (Pause 3s) Every time you choose to eat with awareness, you strengthen this new habit. Your subconscious is learning: I can eat slowly. I can savour. I can listen to my body. (Pause 5s) The world will still offer fast food and distractions. But you no longer have to eat on autopilot. You can choose presence. (Pause 3s) Some meals will still be rushed by circumstance. Your job is not to be perfect. Your job is to return to mindfulness whenever you can. (Pause 5s) Each time you savour a mouthful, you prove to yourself that mindful eating is possible. That you can do this. That the old pattern is losing its grip. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the sensory feast. You have connected with eating with intention. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body will remember. When the urge to eat mindlessly arises, you can answer with a breath. With the image of the single piece of food. With the knowledge that you can savour. (Pause 3s) You deserve to feel this calm around food. You deserve to eat with joy and satisfaction. The sensory feast is yours. Use it. Trust it. You eat with intention now. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen to this script again, the connection to the sensory feast will deepen. Your capacity for mindful eating will grow. (Pause 5s) You are not becoming someone else. You are allowing a part of yourself that has always had the capacity for mindful eating to take the lead. (Pause 3s) Many people eat without tasting. You are choosing to taste. To savour. To nourish yourself with awareness. (Pause 5s) The serene space is yours. The sensory feast is yours. The feeling of eating with intention is yours. (Pause 3s) So as you go back into your day, carry the sensory feast with you. When you sit down to eat, pause. Breathe. Notice the food. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to eat mindfully. You have this experience. You have the image of the sensory feast. You have the choice, from now on, to eat with intention. (Pause 3s) Let that truth guide you. You eat with awareness. You savour. You listen to your body. There is no rush. There is only this meal, this moment, this nourishment. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your mindful eating in the days and weeks to come. (Pause 5s) When you are tempted to eat quickly or distractedly, you can return to this feeling. You can remember that savouring satisfies. That presence nourishes.

That opening is permanent. You eat with intention. Believe it. Live it. (Pause 5s) And whenever the world tries to rush your meals, you can smile inwardly. You know another way. You know the way of the sensory feast. You choose to savour. Again and again. You choose nourishment. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of mindful eating. The gift of the sensory feast.
