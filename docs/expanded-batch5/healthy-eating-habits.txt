## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Nourishment Garden

"Imagine a garden. Lush and alive. (Pause 3s) All around you are plants heavy with fruits, vegetables, and grains. Leaves glisten. Colours are rich and natural. (Pause 3s) You feel the fresh earth beneath your feet. The air is clean and slightly sweet. (Pause 5s) You reach for a ripe fruit. You notice its weight, its colour, its vitality. (Pause 3s) You pick a vegetable. Fresh. Full of life. (Pause 5s) The garden is not about restriction. It is about abundance. About foods that nourish and energise. (Pause 3s) You feel a sense of connection to this place. To the vital energy that flows from the earth into the plants, and from the plants into you. (Pause 5s) This is the nourishment garden. It represents your body's wisdom. Your natural draw towards what truly feeds you. (Pause 3s) Let this feeling draw you deeper into relaxation. The nourishment garden is within you now. You can return to it whenever you need to remember what your body loves. (Pause 5s)"
