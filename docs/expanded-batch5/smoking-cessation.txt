## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Cleansing Breath

"Imagine yourself standing in a high place. Perhaps a mountain path or a hilltop. The air is crisp and clear. (Pause 3s) You take a deep breath in. Cool, clean air fills your lungs. There is no smoke. No heaviness. Just clarity. (Pause 3s) As you exhale slowly, you imagine any trace of nicotine and the old desire leaving your body. (Pause 5s) With each breath in, you draw in freshness. With each breath out, you release what no longer serves you. (Pause 3s) You feel lighter. Freer. Your chest expands easily. Your breath is your own again. (Pause 5s) The cleansing breath is always available. Whenever you feel a craving, you can take a deep breath of crisp air. You can feel the desire dissolve. (Pause 3s) Let this feeling of lightness and freedom draw you deeper into relaxation. You are connected to your smoke-free self. (Pause 5s) The cleansing breath is within you now. You can return to it whenever you need to feel free and light. (Pause 5s)"
