## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Momentum Engine

"Imagine an engine within you. Not loud or harsh, but steady and reliable. (Pause 3s) It is the part of you that knows how to move forward. That thrives on initiating action. (Pause 3s) Feel it warming up. A gentle hum. A sense of readiness. (Pause 5s) This engine does not need to be perfect. It only needs to start. One turn. One small movement. (Pause 3s) And as it starts, it builds. Propelling you forward. Not in a rush, but with steady progress. (Pause 5s) You notice how good it feels to be in motion. The resistance that once held you back softens. (Pause 3s) The momentum engine within you grows stronger with each action you take. It reminds you: the first step is often the easiest once you take it. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling of forward motion draw you deeper into relaxation. You are connected to your capacity for action. (Pause 3s) The momentum engine is within you now. You can return to it whenever you need to begin."

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this relaxed state, your relationship with tasks and action is gently transforming. (Pause 3s) You recognise that procrastination is a pattern, not a permanent part of who you are. Patterns can change. (Pause 5s) Old habits of putting things off, waiting for the right moment, or feeling overwhelmed by the whole task simply soften and fade. In their place, a natural willingness to take the first step grows. (Pause 5s) You discover that any task can be broken into steps. And the first step is always manageable. (Pause 3s) You do not need to see the whole staircase. You only need to take the first step. (Pause 5s) When you feel the urge to delay, you can pause. Breathe. Ask yourself: what is the very first small thing I could do right now? (Pause 5s) That first step creates momentum. Once you are in motion, you stay in motion. (Pause 3s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to initiate. To begin. To take timely action rather than wait. (Pause 5s) You will feel a quiet satisfaction each time you start. Each time you complete something. (Pause 3s) When the old urge to procrastinate arises, you can picture the momentum engine. You can feel it warming up. You can take one small action. (Pause 5s) You are becoming someone who acts. Who begins. Who experiences the relief and pride of accomplishment. (Pause 3s) See yourself tomorrow... facing a task you might have put off. This time, you break it down. You take the first step. You feel the engine engage. (Pause 5s) See yourself next week... completing things in good time. No last-minute rushes. No guilt. Just steady progress. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... procrastination losing its grip. You initiate more easily. You feel lighter. More in control. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the momentum engine. It will help you take the first step when the old habit of delay tries to return. (Pause 5s) Taking action is a gift you give yourself. It reduces anxiety. It builds confidence. It creates a sense of accomplishment. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of momentum sink in. You have the capacity to begin. To take the first step. To keep moving. (Pause 3s) The engine is within you. Whenever you feel stuck, you can return to this feeling. You can take one small action. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel the satisfaction of timely action. You deserve to be free from the weight of procrastination. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, initiating action is your default. You are building a life of momentum and accomplishment. One step at a time. (Pause 5s) Trust that the first step is enough. Trust that momentum will carry you. And in the meantime, you can begin. With ease. With the knowledge that you are capable. (Pause 5s) At work, you will break projects into steps and start with the easiest one. At home, you will tackle one small task and feel the engine engage. (Pause 3s) When a task feels big, you will ask: what is the first five-minute step? You will do that. And then the next. (Pause 5s) When you complete something, you will pause to acknowledge it. You will feel the pride of accomplishment. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious is now aligned with action. It will remind you of the momentum engine. It will remind you that the first step is the key. It will help you choose to begin rather than delay. (Pause 3s) Let that truth settle in. You can take the first step. You can build momentum. You have this resource now. Use it well. (Pause 3s) The momentum engine is yours. It will never judge. It will always remind you: you can start. You can move. You can accomplish. (Pause 3s) When you feel the pull to put something off, you can take one tiny action. When you feel overwhelmed, you can break the task down and do just the first bit. When you have completed something, you can take a moment to feel good about it. (Pause 5s) You recognise that breaking tasks into steps removes the overwhelm. The whole project may feel big, but the first step is always small. You give yourself permission to do just that first step and then the next. Momentum builds naturally. You do not need to wait for motivation. Action creates motivation. The more you practise taking the first step, the more natural it becomes. Your brain learns that starting is safe and that accomplishment feels good. Timely action reduces the anxiety that comes from leaving things to the last minute. (Pause 5s) Overcoming procrastination is a gift you give yourself. It frees your mind. It builds self-trust. It creates a life of timely action. (Pause 5s) You may have struggled with procrastination in the past. Now you are building a new pattern. One of initiation, momentum, and accomplishment. (Pause 3s) Every time you choose to take the first step, you strengthen this new habit. Your subconscious is learning: I can begin. I can take small steps. I can accomplish. (Pause 5s) The world will still offer distractions. But you no longer have to be ruled by delay. You can choose to start. (Pause 3s) Some tasks will still feel daunting. Your job is not to do everything at once. Your job is to take the first step. (Pause 5s) Each time you initiate, you prove to yourself that momentum is possible. That you can do this. That the old pattern is losing its grip. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the momentum engine. You have connected with your capacity for action. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body will remember. When the urge to procrastinate arises, you can answer with one small action. With the image of the engine. With the knowledge that the first step is enough. (Pause 3s) You deserve to feel the relief of timely action. You deserve to accomplish without last-minute stress. The momentum engine is yours. Use it. Trust it. You take action now. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen to this script again, the connection to the momentum engine will deepen. Your capacity to initiate will grow. (Pause 5s) You are not becoming someone else. You are allowing a part of yourself that has always had the capacity for action to take the lead. (Pause 3s) Many people wait for the perfect moment. You are choosing to take the first step. To build momentum. To accomplish. (Pause 5s) The engine is yours. The feeling of forward motion is yours. The pride of accomplishment is yours. (Pause 3s) So as you go back into your day, carry the momentum engine with you. When you feel stuck, take one small step. Feel the engine engage. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to overcome procrastination. You have this experience. You have the image of the momentum engine. You have the choice, from now on, to begin. (Pause 3s) Let that truth guide you. You can initiate. You can take the first step. You can accomplish. There is no need to wait. The first step is always available. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your timely action in the days and weeks to come. (Pause 5s) When you are tempted to put something off, you can return to this feeling. You can remember that the first step is manageable. That momentum follows action.

That awakening is permanent. You take action. Believe it. Live it. (Pause 5s) And whenever the old habit of delay tries to return, you can smile inwardly. You know another way. You know the way of the momentum engine. You choose to begin. Again and again. You choose accomplishment. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of momentum. The gift of the momentum engine. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body have learned something today. They will remember. When you need to start, you will take the first step. When you need to keep going, you will feel the engine carry you.

Timely action is your choice. From this day forward. You are ready. You accomplish. Go in peace."

## Termination

"Now, it is time to gently return to your full waking awareness, bringing with you all the positive feelings of momentum, action, and accomplishment. (Pause 3s) I will count from one to five, and with each number, you will feel more and more alert, refreshed, and ready to engage with your day.

One... beginning to feel a gentle energy returning to your body. You are safe and grounded.
