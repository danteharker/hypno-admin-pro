## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Flowing River of Progress

"Imagine a river. It moves steadily forward. Not in a straight line, but with curves and bends. (Pause 3s) Sometimes the water swirls in eddies. Little pools of stillness. And then it moves on again. (Pause 3s) The river does not judge itself for the eddies. It does not demand a perfect path. It simply flows. (Pause 5s) You notice that progress is not a straight line. It is movement. It is flow. (Pause 3s) The river reaches the sea not because every moment was perfect, but because it kept moving. (Pause 5s) As you watch this river, you feel a sense of ease. You do not have to be perfect. You only have to keep going. (Pause 3s) Eddies are part of the journey. So is the flow. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling draw you deeper into relaxation. The river of progress is within you now. You can return to it whenever you need to remember that progress matters more than perfection. (Pause 5s)"

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this calm state, your relationship with excellence and perfection is gently transforming. (Pause 3s) You recognise that excellence is achievable and satisfying, while perfection is a moving target that keeps you stuck. (Pause 5s) You choose excellence over paralysis. Good enough over never done. (Pause 5s) Old patterns of holding back, endlessly revising, or refusing to share your work until it is perfect simply soften and fade. In their place, a willingness to complete and share grows. (Pause 3s) You set realistic expectations. You know that progress is more valuable than a flawless first attempt. (Pause 5s) You offer yourself the same compassion you might offer a friend. You would not demand perfection from them. You no longer demand it from yourself. (Pause 5s) When you feel the old urge to polish something endlessly or hide your work, you can picture the flowing river. Progress, not a straight line. Eddies and flow. (Pause 3s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to complete things. To call them good enough. To share your work with the world. (Pause 5s) You will feel relief when you release something rather than hold it in endless revision. (Pause 3s) See yourself tomorrow... finishing something and letting it go. Not perfect. Good enough. Done. (Pause 5s) See yourself next week... sharing work or ideas without waiting for perfection. Feeling the freedom of completion. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... perfectionism losing its grip. You complete. You share. You progress. With self-compassion. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the river of progress. It will help you choose completion over paralysis when the old habit tries to return. (Pause 5s) Completing and sharing your work is a gift you give yourself. It builds confidence. It creates impact. It frees you from the prison of perfection. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of progress sink in. You have the capacity to be good enough. To complete. To move forward. (Pause 3s) The river is within you. Whenever you feel stuck in perfectionism, you can return to this feeling. You can remember that the river flows. (Pause 5s) You deserve to complete your work. You deserve to share it. You deserve self-compassion. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, progress over perfection is your default. You are building a life of completion and flow. One project at a time. (Pause 5s) Trust that good enough is often better than perfect. Trust that done is better than perfect. And in the meantime, you can complete. You can share. You can flow. (Pause 5s) At work, you will set realistic standards and meet them. You will hand in work that is good enough and improve from feedback. (Pause 3s) In creative projects, you will finish and release. You will not hide your work until it is flawless. (Pause 5s) When you notice the inner critic demanding perfection, you will offer yourself compassion. You will ask: would I speak to a friend this way? (Pause 5s) You recognise that excellence is achievable and rewarding. You can aim high without demanding the impossible. Realistic expectations free you to do more, not less. When you complete something and share it, you learn. Feedback helps you improve. Hiding your work until it is perfect means you never learn and never grow. You deserve to share your contributions with the world. Done is better than perfect. Finished work has value; work that never sees the light of day helps no one. You can revise and improve after sharing. The flowing river does not wait for the perfect route; it moves. So do you. You can be kind to yourself when something is not perfect. You can celebrate completion. You can allow yourself to be a learner, to improve over time, and to share your work with realistic expectations. Progress over paralysis becomes your mantra. You recognise that good enough is often the best choice because it allows you to move forward, learn, and make an impact. You give yourself permission to complete and share. The river of progress flows through you. You complete and share with confidence and ease. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious is now aligned with progress. It will remind you of the river. It will remind you that eddies are part of the journey. It will help you choose completion over paralysis. (Pause 3s) Let that truth settle in. You can complete. You can share. You can progress. You have this resource now. Use it well. (Pause 3s) The river of progress is yours. It will never demand a straight line. It will always remind you: flow. Complete. Good enough is enough. (Pause 3s) When you feel the pull to perfect something endlessly, you can picture the river. When you are afraid to share, you can remember that progress is the goal. When you complete something, you can celebrate. (Pause 5s) Overcoming perfectionism is a gift you give yourself. It frees your creativity. It builds confidence. It allows you to make an impact. (Pause 5s) You may have struggled with perfectionism in the past. Now you are building a new pattern. One of progress, completion, and self-compassion. (Pause 3s) Every time you choose to complete and share, you strengthen this new habit. Your subconscious is learning: I can finish. I can be good enough. I can progress. (Pause 5s) The world will still have critics. But you no longer have to be your own harshest critic. You can choose to complete and share. (Pause 3s) Some work will still feel imperfect. Your job is not to make it flawless. Your job is to make it good enough and let it go. (Pause 5s) Each time you complete and share, you prove to yourself that progress is possible. That you can do this. That the old pattern is losing its grip. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the river of progress. You have connected with completion and self-compassion. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body will remember. When perfectionism whispers, you can answer with the image of the river. With the knowledge that progress matters. With the choice to complete. (Pause 3s) You deserve to finish your work. You deserve to share it. You deserve self-compassion. The river of progress is yours. Use it. Trust it. You progress now. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen to this script again, the connection to the river will deepen. Your capacity to complete and share will grow. (Pause 5s) You are not becoming someone else. You are allowing a part of yourself that has always been capable of progress to take the lead. (Pause 3s) Many people never share their work because they wait for perfection. You are choosing to complete. To share. To flow. (Pause 5s) The river is yours. The feeling of progress is yours. The relief of completion is yours. (Pause 3s) So as you go back into your day, carry the river of progress with you. When you feel the urge to perfect endlessly, remember the river. Complete. Share. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to overcome perfectionism. You have this experience. You have the image of the river. You have the choice, from now on, to progress. (Pause 3s) Let that truth guide you. You complete. You share. You progress. Good enough is enough. The river flows. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your progress in the days and weeks to come. (Pause 5s) When you are tempted to hold back or revise endlessly, you can return to this feeling. You can remember that the river moves. That done is better than perfect. (Pause 5s) You deserve to be free from the grip of perfectionism. You deserve the satisfaction of completion. (Pause 3s) The river of progress has opened something in you. That opening is permanent. You choose progress. Believe it. Live it. (Pause 5s) And whenever the old habit of perfectionism tries to return, you can smile inwardly. You know another way. You know the way of the river. You choose to complete. Again and again. You choose progress. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of progress. The gift of the flowing river. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body have learned something today. They will remember. When you need to complete, you will. When you need to share, you will. (Pause 3s) You are building a life of progress and completion. One project at a time. The river is within you. You can return to it whenever perfectionism calls. You complete. You flow. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, let the river of progress guide you. When you feel the urge to perfect endlessly, picture the river. Complete. Share. (Pause 5s) You have trained your mind for progress. That training will stay with you. (Pause 3s) Honour this change. Use it. You deserve to complete and share your work. The river of progress is yours for life. (Pause 3s) And as we bring you back to full awareness, hold on to that feeling. You can complete. You can share. You do not need perfection. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious will remind you. Whenever perfectionism rises, you can return to the river. To the flow. To the peace of progress. (Pause 3s) You choose progress over perfection. You have connected with this today. Trust that. Live that. You complete. You share. Good enough is enough. (Pause 3s) The river of progress is part of you now. It will be there whenever you need to remember that progress matters more than perfection. (Pause 5s) You have taken an important step. You have connected with the river of progress. Let it guide you. Let it ease your relationship with your work. You deserve this freedom. You have earned it. The river is always with you. (Pause 3s) So go forward into your day with this ease. With this progress. With the knowledge that you can complete and share. (Pause 5s) Your mind has received this training. It will support you. You are ready. You progress. Believe it. (Pause 3s) You have the river of progress. You have the capacity to complete. Use them well. You are free from the grip of perfectionism. Progress is your choice. From this day forward. You are ready. You flow. Go in peace."

## Termination

"Now, it is time to gently return to your full waking awareness, bringing with you all the positive feelings of progress, completion, and self-compassion. (Pause 3s) I will count from one to five, and with each number, you will feel more and more alert, refreshed, and ready to engage with your day.

One... beginning to feel a gentle energy returning to your body. You are safe and grounded.
Two... becoming more aware of your surroundings, feeling grounded and present in the room.
Three... feeling refreshed and invigorated, carrying your newfound ease with progress and completion with you into your day.
