## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Optimism Garden

"Imagine yourself walking into a beautiful, vibrant garden. This is the Optimism Garden. (Pause 3s) The path beneath your feet is soft and welcoming. The air is warm and still. (Pause 3s) Every flower is blooming. Every plant is thriving. You see roses, lavender, sunflowers... colours that lift your spirits. The scent is sweet and fresh. (Pause 5s) The sunlight is golden, illuminating every corner with positivity. There are no shadows of doubt here. No weeds of worry. (Pause 5s) As you walk deeper into the garden, you feel a profound sense of hope and joy filling your entire being. Your chest feels light. Your mind feels clear. (Pause 5s) You notice a bench in a sunny spot. You sit down. You breathe. You take in the beauty around you. (Pause 3s) This garden exists within you. It is a place you can return to whenever you need to feel hope. Whenever you need to remember that good things are possible. (Pause 5s) With each breath, you draw in the positivity of this place. You draw in the optimism. You draw in the belief that life can be good. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling deepen. You are in the Optimism Garden. And it is drawing you deeper into a state of profound hope and relaxation."

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this Optimism Garden, feel a powerful sense of positive thinking awakening within you. (Pause 3s) You recognise that your thoughts create your reality. What you focus on grows. You have the power to choose thoughts that empower and uplift you. (Pause 5s) Any old patterns of negative self-talk... worry... pessimism... simply dissolve and fade away. They are like clouds passing over the garden. The sun is still there. The flowers are still there. (Pause 5s) In their place, a profound sense of hope, confidence, and constructive thinking grows. (Pause 3s) Imagine yourself encountering a challenge. In the past you might have focused on what could go wrong. Now, you instinctively look for solutions. For opportunities. For positive outcomes. (Pause 5s) You reframe difficulties as learning experiences. Setbacks become temporary detours, not proof that you are failing. (Pause 3s) Your inner dialogue becomes one of encouragement. Of belief. Of possibility. You see the good in every situation and in every person. (Pause 5s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to cultivate positive thinking.

Positivity becomes a natural and effortless part of your being. (Pause 3s) You are a positive thinker. You embrace your ability to create a joyful and fulfilling life. (Pause 5s) When a negative thought arises, you can notice it without following it. You can say to yourself: I choose a different thought. (Pause 3s) When you hear bad news, you can feel the impact, and then you can ask: what is one thing I can do? What is one reason for hope? (Pause 5s) You do not deny difficulty. You simply refuse to let difficulty be the only story. You look for the helpers. The lessons. The silver linings. (Pause 5s) See yourself tomorrow... waking with a sense of possibility. You do not know what the day will bring, but you trust that you can handle it. (Pause 3s) See yourself next week... facing something that would once have made you anxious or gloomy. This time, you feel steadier. You look for the good. You take constructive action. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... your default mindset shifting. You catch yourself smiling more. Noticing beauty more. Feeling grateful more. (Pause 5s) People may notice that you are easier to be around. That you bring a sense of hope into the room. That you see possibilities they had not considered. (Pause 3s) You are not pretending that everything is fine. You are simply choosing to focus on what is working, what is growing, and what is possible. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you to look for the good.

One thought at a time. (Pause 3s) When you catch yourself complaining or criticising, you can pause and ask: what is one good thing about this situation? What is one thing I am grateful for right now? (Pause 5s) You are not ignoring problems. You are balancing your perspective. You are giving your mind more to work with than just fear and lack. (Pause 5s) Research shows that a positive mindset supports resilience, health, and relationships. You are not being naive. You are being wise. (Pause 3s) Imagine yourself at the end of the day, reflecting. You notice three good things that happened. They might be small. A kind word. A completed task. A moment of laughter. (Pause 5s) You train your brain to notice these. The more you look for good, the more good you see. (Pause 3s) When someone else is negative, you can listen with compassion and still hold on to your own hope. You do not have to join them in despair. You can be the one who says: what if it works out? (Pause 5s) Your subconscious will now default to possibility. It will look for solutions. It will remind you of your strengths. It will help you bounce back from setbacks. (Pause 5s) The Optimism Garden is always there. You can visit it in a moment. You can fill your mind with the colours and the light and the hope.

You can take one breath and remember: I choose hope. (Pause 5s) Your brain is being retrained. Every time you notice something good, every time you reframe a difficulty, every time you choose possibility over fear, you strengthen the pathway. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel positive. You deserve to believe that your efforts matter and that good things can happen. (Pause 3s) So as we prepare to bring you back, hold on to the feeling of the garden. The sunlight. The flowers. The hope. (Pause 5s) Take that with you. You are a positive thinker. You have the Optimism Garden within you. Use it every day.
