## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Mirror of Truth

"Imagine yourself standing before a magnificent, shimmering mirror. This is no ordinary mirror. This is the Mirror of Truth. (Pause 3s) Perhaps you are in a quiet, peaceful room. The air is still. The light is soft. There is no rush. No one else is here. (Pause 3s) The frame of the mirror glows with a soft, warm light. The glass is crystal clear, and yet it reflects something more than your ordinary reflection. It reflects your true essence... your inner light... and all your wonderful qualities. (Pause 5s)

As you gaze into this mirror, you see yourself with absolute clarity. There is no judgment here. No self-criticism. No harsh voice. (Pause 3s) You see your strengths... your kindness... your unique talents... your inherent worth. You see the person you are when you are at your best. You see the resilience that has carried you through difficult times. You see the warmth you offer to others. You see the times you have been brave, the times you have been kind, the times you have tried again when it would have been easier to give up. (Pause 5s)

Perhaps you notice a gentle light around the reflection... a glow that comes from within. That is your inner worth... your value... your right to be here, exactly as you are. (Pause 3s) With each moment you spend before this mirror, you feel a profound sense of self-acceptance and love. You feel it in your chest... in your heart... spreading through your whole body. This feeling draws you deeper into a state of unwavering self-esteem. (Pause 5s) You might notice the expression on the face in the mirror... calm, kind, at peace. That is how you can look at yourself from now on. With kindness. With respect. (Pause 3s) The mirror holds this truth for you: you are enough. You have always been enough. You are deserving of love, respect, and happiness. (Pause 3s) And as you take one more look into this Mirror of Truth, you allow that truth to sink in... deeper and deeper... into the very core of who you are. You carry this mirror within you now. Whenever you need to remember your worth, you can close your eyes and see it again."

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, as you stand before this Mirror of Truth, feel a powerful sense of self-esteem radiating from within you. (Pause 3s) You recognise that you are a unique, valuable, and capable individual. You are deserving of love. You are deserving of respect. You are deserving of happiness. (Pause 5s) Any old beliefs about not being good enough... any negative self-talk... any harsh words you may have repeated to yourself in the past... simply dissolve and fade away. They lose their power. They drift off like clouds clearing from a bright sky. (Pause 5s) In their place, a profound sense of inner confidence grows. It grows with every breath. It grows with every beat of your heart. (Pause 3s) You may feel it as a warmth in your chest. You may feel it as a sense of solidity, of being grounded. However you feel it, it is real. It is yours. It has always been available to you, and now you are allowing yourself to access it fully. (Pause 5s)

Imagine yourself moving through your daily life with this newfound sense of self-assurance. (Pause 3s) You speak kindly to yourself. When you make a mistake, you respond with understanding, not blame. You celebrate your successes, no matter how small. You learn from challenges without punishing yourself. (Pause 5s) You set healthy boundaries, because you know your worth. You say no when you need to, and yes when it serves you. You attract positive relationships and opportunities into your life, because you carry this quiet confidence with you. (Pause 3s) You trust your intuition. You make decisions that align with your highest good. You no longer seek constant approval from others, because you have found approval within yourself. (Pause 5s) People may notice a change in you. They may see you standing a little taller, speaking a little more clearly, taking opportunities you might once have avoided. That is because you are no longer waiting for permission to feel good about yourself. You have given yourself that permission. (Pause 5s) You no longer need to put yourself down to seem humble. True humility is not the same as thinking you are worth less. You can be kind to yourself and still be kind to others. You can believe in your own value and still celebrate the value of those around you. (Pause 5s) You notice the things you do well. You notice the ways you help others. You notice the progress you have made. You do not dismiss these things. You let them count. (Pause 3s) And when you look in an ordinary mirror, you can choose to see what the Mirror of Truth showed you: a person of value, a person who is enough, a person who deserves kindness from themselves most of all.

See yourself tomorrow... waking up with this same feeling. You look in the mirror and you see someone you respect. Someone you value. (Pause 3s) See yourself next week... in a situation that might once have made you doubt yourself. This time, you feel steady. You feel capable. You respond with confidence. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... your self-esteem naturally growing stronger each day. You appreciate your unique qualities. You acknowledge your achievements. You treat yourself with kindness and compassion. (Pause 3s) You are building a solid foundation of self-love and self-respect. That foundation will support you in all areas of your life: in your work, in your relationships, in your health, in your dreams. (Pause 5s)

When you are at work, you know that your contributions matter. You speak up when you have something to say. You ask for what you need. You accept feedback without taking it as a verdict on your worth. (Pause 5s) When you are with family or friends, you show up as yourself. You do not shrink to please others. You do not exaggerate to impress. You are simply, fully, you. (Pause 3s) When you are alone, you enjoy your own company. You do not need constant distraction or validation from outside. You can rest in the knowledge that you are good company for yourself. (Pause 5s) In moments of stress or criticism, you can return to this feeling. You can remember the Mirror of Truth. You can remember that one person's opinion or one difficult day does not define you. Your worth is not on trial. It is settled. (Pause 5s)

Every time you notice a critical thought about yourself, you can pause... take a breath... and choose a kinder thought. Every time you achieve something, you can take a moment to recognise it. Every time you face a difficulty, you can remind yourself that you have overcome difficulties before, and you will again. (Pause 3s) You are confident. You are capable. You are truly worthy. This is not something you have to earn. It is something you already are. (Pause 5s)

Imagine yourself in a conversation where someone pays you a compliment. In the past you might have brushed it off or doubted it. Now, you can receive it. You can let it in. You can believe it, because it aligns with what you know to be true about yourself. (Pause 5s) Imagine yourself in a meeting or a social situation where you might once have held back. Now you contribute. You share your ideas. You take up space, because you know your perspective matters. (Pause 3s) Imagine yourself at the end of the day, reflecting on what went well. You notice your efforts. You acknowledge your progress. You do not dismiss your achievements or focus only on what went wrong. (Pause 5s) Your inner voice becomes a supportive friend. It encourages you. It reminds you of your strengths. It helps you learn from setbacks without shame. (Pause 3s) You begin to notice how often you have been harder on yourself than you would ever be on someone you loved. You can change that pattern now. You can offer yourself the same compassion you so easily offer to others. (Pause 5s) When you catch yourself comparing to others, you can gently redirect. You are not in competition with anyone. Your journey is your own. Your progress is your own. Your worth is not measured by anyone else's achievements. (Pause 5s) When you feel uncertain or nervous, you can remind yourself: I have value. I have survived every difficult day so far. I am learning and growing. I am allowed to take up space. I am allowed to want good things for myself. (Pause 5s) These thoughts become natural. They become your default. They are not arrogant or selfish. They are simply the truth. (Pause 3s) And from this moment forward, your subconscious mind holds this truth. It holds it so that you can return to it whenever you need. You are enough. You have always been enough. You are building a life rooted in self-esteem, self-respect, and self-love. That life is unfolding now, one kind thought at a time. (Pause 3s) So let this sink in one more time: you are worthy of respect. You are worthy of love. You are worthy of success and happiness. You do not have to prove it. You do not have to earn it. You simply have to allow yourself to feel it. (Pause 5s) Some days will feel easier than others. That is normal. On the days when old doubts creep in, you have this session to return to. You have the Mirror of Truth. You have the knowledge that your worth does not depend on your mood, your productivity, or anyone else's opinion. (Pause 5s) You can listen to this script again whenever you wish. Each time, the suggestions go in a little deeper. Each time, the foundation of self-esteem grows a little stronger. (Pause 3s) The Mirror of Truth has shown you who you are. Hold that image. Carry it with you. And whenever the old doubts try to return, you can close your eyes, take a breath, and see that mirror again. Your worth is not up for debate. It is settled. It is real. It is yours. (Pause 3s) So from this day forward, allow your self-esteem to guide you. Let it inform your choices. Let it protect your boundaries. Let it remind you that you deserve the same care and respect you so freely give to others. You are building a life of self-respect, one moment at a time. And that life starts now. (Pause 3s) Whenever you hear a critical voice in your mind, you can pause and ask: would I speak this way to someone I love? If not, you do not need to speak this way to yourself. You can replace that thought with a kinder one. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious mind has received these suggestions. It will hold them. It will reinforce them. You have everything you need to maintain and grow your self-esteem. You have this experience. You have the Mirror of Truth within you. You have the choice, from now on, to treat yourself with the respect and kindness you truly deserve. (Pause 3s) Remember: you are worthy. You are enough. You are deserving of your own love and respect. Let that truth guide you every day."

## Termination

"Now, it is time to gently return to your full waking awareness, bringing with you all the positive feelings of enhanced self-esteem, inner confidence, and self-acceptance. (Pause 3s) I will count from one to five, and with each number, you will feel more and more alert, refreshed, and ready to engage with your day.

One... beginning to feel a gentle energy returning to your body. You are safe and grounded.
Two... becoming more aware of your surroundings, feeling grounded and present in the room.
Three... feeling refreshed and invigorated, carrying your boosted self-esteem with you into your day.
Four... your mind is clear, your body is energised, and you are ready to open your eyes.
And five... eyes open, wide awake, feeling absolutely wonderful, confident, and full of self-worth. (Pause 3s) Take a moment to stretch if you wish. Remember: you carry this feeling with you. You are worthy. You are enough."
