## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Still Pond

"Imagine yourself sitting beside a perfectly still pond, nestled in a quiet, secluded forest. (Pause 3s) The air is fresh and clean. The temperature is gentle... not too warm, not too cool. You feel completely comfortable. (Pause 3s) The surface of the water is like a mirror, reflecting the clear blue sky and the surrounding trees without a single ripple. You can see every leaf, every branch, every cloud reflected in that still surface. (Pause 5s) The only sounds you hear are the gentle rustling of leaves and the distant chirping of birds. There is no traffic. No voices. No demands. Just this peaceful place. (Pause 5s) As you gaze into the still water, you feel your mind becoming as calm and clear as the pond. Thoughts may arise... and like ripples, they appear for a moment and then fade away. The surface returns to stillness. (Pause 5s) With each breath, you sink deeper into this tranquility. You are the observer of the pond. You are the observer of your thoughts. You are not carried away by them. You rest in the stillness beneath. (Pause 5s) Perhaps you notice the colours around you... the green of the trees, the blue of the sky, the dark clarity of the water. Perhaps you feel the soft ground beneath you, or the gentle air on your skin. (Pause 3s) All of this supports your peace. There is nothing to do here. Nothing to fix. Nothing to achieve. You are simply being. (Pause 5s) This pond is your inner sanctuary. You can return here whenever you wish. For now, let it draw you deeper into a state of profound inner peace and calm."

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this state of deep tranquility, feel a profound sense of inner peace settling within you. (Pause 3s) Any thoughts that arise are like gentle ripples on the surface of the pond. They appear, and then they fade away, leaving the surface calm and clear once more. You observe your thoughts without attachment. You know that you are the observer, not the thoughts themselves. (Pause 5s) Imagine a warm, soft light glowing in the centre of your chest. This light is your inner peace. Your sanctuary of calm. (Pause 3s) Feel it expanding with each breath. Feel it radiating throughout your entire being... soothing every nerve, relaxing every muscle, bringing a profound stillness to your mind. (Pause 5s) You are connected to an endless source of peace and serenity. It has always been there. You are simply allowing yourself to feel it now. (Pause 5s)

From this moment forward, you will find it easier to access this inner sanctuary of calm. Whenever you feel overwhelmed or stressed, you can take a breath... picture the still pond... and return to this feeling of peace within. (Pause 5s) You do not need to be in a forest to find it. You carry it with you. It is in your breath. It is in your chest. It is in the pause between one thought and the next. (Pause 3s) You will respond to external circumstances with greater composure and clarity. When chaos happens around you, you can find the still point within. When others are agitated, you can remain centred. (Pause 5s) This does not mean you will never feel stress or emotion. It means you will have a place to return to. A refuge. A default setting of calm that you can access whenever you choose. (Pause 5s)

See yourself tomorrow... waking and taking a moment to breathe. Before you check your phone or rush into the day, you connect with this feeling. Just for a few seconds. The still pond is there. (Pause 5s) See yourself in a situation that used to make you anxious or irritable. This time, you pause. You breathe. You feel the peace in your chest. You respond from that place. (Pause 3s) See yourself at the end of a busy day... able to let go of the day's tensions. You do not carry them into the evening. You return to calm. (Pause 5s) See yourself in a disagreement with someone you care about. Instead of escalating, you stay calm. You listen. You speak from the still place. The conversation may still be difficult, but you are not lost in reaction. (Pause 5s) See yourself facing uncertainty... a change at work, a health concern, a decision that matters. You feel the worry, and then you feel the peace beneath it. You know that you can handle what comes. You have your inner sanctuary. (Pause 5s) You are cultivating a deep and lasting sense of tranquility that will enrich every aspect of your life. Your sleep may improve. Your digestion may improve. Your ability to think clearly under pressure will improve. (Pause 5s) People may begin to say that you seem more relaxed. That you are easier to be around. That they feel calmer when they are with you. (Pause 3s) That is because you are no longer leaking tension into every room. You are holding your peace. And that peace is contagious in the best way. (Pause 5s) You do not have to meditate for hours to benefit. Even a few seconds of connecting with the still pond can shift your state. (Pause 3s) You can set a reminder on your phone to breathe and return to calm three times a day. You can use the moment when you sit down at your desk, or when you wait for the kettle to boil, or when you are walking from one place to another. (Pause 5s) Peace does not require a special place or a special time. It requires only your attention. Your intention. Your willingness to pause. (Pause 5s) As you continue to practise, you will find that the still pond is always there. Even in the middle of a crisis. Even when you are tired or ill or overwhelmed. (Pause 3s) You may not feel perfectly calm in every moment. But you will always have a place to return to. A home base. A default. (Pause 5s) Your relationships will benefit from your calm. Your decisions will benefit from your clarity. Your body will benefit from the absence of constant tension. (Pause 5s)

Whenever you notice your mind racing or your shoulders tightening, you can say to yourself: I can return to the still pond. (Pause 3s) You can do it in a meeting. You can do it in a queue. You can do it in the middle of a difficult conversation. One breath. One moment. The peace is there. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious mind is now programmed to support this. It will remind you to breathe. It will remind you that you have a choice about how you respond. It will help you find that still, calm place even when the world around you is noisy. (Pause 5s) You are becoming a person who carries peace within. Not because life is always easy. But because you have learned where to find stillness, and you can go there whenever you need. (Pause 3s) When you are stuck in traffic, you can use that time to breathe and return to the pond. When you receive difficult news, you can pause before reacting and find your centre. When you lie in bed at night with a busy mind, you can picture the still water and let the ripples settle. (Pause 5s) Peace is not something that happens to you when everything is perfect. It is something you cultivate. Something you choose. Something you practise. (Pause 5s) And the more you return to this feeling, the easier it becomes. The pathway is well worn. Your mind knows the way. (Pause 3s) You may notice that you no longer need to control every outcome to feel okay. You can allow life to unfold and still remain calm. You can care deeply about things and still have an inner refuge that is undisturbed. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling deepen now. Let it sink into every cell. You are calm. You are at peace. You are safe. And this peace is yours to keep. (Pause 3s) Whenever stress or worry tries to take over, you have a choice. You can follow the worry down its spiral, or you can take one breath and return to the still pond. Your subconscious will help you remember. You have this resource now. Use it often. (Pause 5s) In the past you may have believed that peace was for other people. For people with easier lives. For people who did not have your responsibilities or your worries. (Pause 5s) That was never true. Peace is available to everyone. It does not depend on your circumstances. It depends on your willingness to turn inward and find the still water that has been there all along. (Pause 5s) Some days you will forget. You will get caught up in the rush and the noise. When that happens, do not criticise yourself. Simply notice, and take the next opportunity to breathe and return. (Pause 3s) Each time you return to the pond, you strengthen the pathway. You are training your nervous system. You are teaching your mind that it is safe to rest. (Pause 5s) Your body will thank you. Your mind will thank you. The people around you will notice the calm you carry. And you will notice how much more energy you have when you are not constantly braced against the world. (Pause 3s) So take one more moment here, in this stillness. Feel the peace. Remember it. And know that you can find it again whenever you need it. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received this training. It will remind you to breathe. It will bring to mind the image of the still pond when you need it most. (Pause 5s) You are building a lifelong habit of inner calm. A habit that will support your health, your relationships, and your sense of wellbeing. (Pause 3s) The forest and the pond are within you now. They go with you everywhere. You are never without access to peace. You only need to turn your attention inward and allow the stillness to rise. (Pause 5s) Let that truth settle in. You are a person who can find peace. You are a person who deserves to feel calm. And from this moment on, you have the tools to make it so. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen to this script again, the suggestions will go in deeper. The pathway to the still pond will become even clearer. (Pause 5s) You have taken an important step today. You have connected with your inner sanctuary. Honour that. Return to it often. Let peace become your default, not the exception. (Pause 3s) You deserve to feel calm. You deserve to have a refuge within. You have found it. Now it is yours for life. (Pause 3s) So as we prepare to bring you back to full awareness, hold on to this feeling. Let it fill you. The still pond. The calm. The knowledge that you can return whenever you choose. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body have received this gift. They will remember. Trust that. (Pause 3s) And whenever life feels too loud or too fast, you know what to do. Breathe. Picture the pond. Return to peace. You have that power now. It is always available. Use it well. You deserve this calm. You have earned it."

## Termination

"Now, it is time to gently return to your full waking awareness, bringing with you all the positive feelings of inner peace, calm, and serenity. (Pause 3s) I will count from one to five, and with each number, you will feel more and more alert, refreshed, and ready to engage with your day.

One... beginning to feel a gentle energy returning to your body. You are safe and grounded.
Two... becoming more aware of your surroundings, feeling grounded and present in the room.
Three... feeling refreshed and invigorated, carrying your newfound inner peace with you into your day.
Four... your mind is clear, your body is energised, and you are ready to open your eyes.
And five... eyes open, wide awake, feeling absolutely wonderful, peaceful, and ready to embrace your day with a calm and centred presence. (Pause 3s) Remember: the still pond is within you. You can return to it anytime."
