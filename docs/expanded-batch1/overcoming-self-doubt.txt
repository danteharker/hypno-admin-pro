## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Inner Champion

"Imagine yourself stepping into a magnificent arena. The space is vast. The light is clear. (Pause 3s) This is the place where your Inner Champion resides. (Pause 3s) Your Inner Champion is powerful. Confident. Unwavering in their belief in you. (Pause 5s) They have seen you at your best. They have seen you overcome obstacles. They have never doubted your potential. (Pause 5s) As you stand in this arena, you feel your champion's presence. Perhaps you see a figure in the distance. Perhaps you feel a hand on your shoulder. Perhaps you simply feel a surge of strength in your chest. (Pause 5s) As you connect with this Inner Champion, you feel courage and self-assurance flowing through your entire being. (Pause 3s) With each breath, you absorb more of this champion's energy. You draw in their belief. Their confidence. Their certainty that you can do whatever you set your mind to. (Pause 5s) The doubts that sometimes whisper in your ear have no place here. This arena belongs to your champion. And your champion belongs to you. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling deepen. You are in the presence of your Inner Champion. And they believe in you completely. (Pause 3s) That belief is yours to carry. It has always been there. You are simply allowing yourself to feel it now."

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this arena with your Inner Champion, bring your awareness to any feelings of self-doubt you may have been carrying. (Pause 3s) Imagine these doubts as small, wispy clouds. They drift into the arena... and in the powerful presence of your champion, they simply dissipate. They have no substance. They have no power here. (Pause 5s) You recognise that self-doubt is merely a habit of thought. It is not the truth. It is not a fact. It is a pattern that can be changed. (Pause 5s) You have the power to choose thoughts that empower and uplift you. (Pause 3s) Your Inner Champion reminds you of all your past successes. Every challenge you have faced. Every time you learned something new. Every time you got back up after a fall. (Pause 5s) They remind you of your unique talents. Your inherent strengths. Your incredible resilience. (Pause 3s) You have overcome challenges before. You have learned and grown. You are capable of achieving anything you set your mind to. (Pause 5s) This truth resonates deep within your being. It is not arrogance. It is accuracy. (Pause 3s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to silence the voice of self-doubt. When the old voice says you cannot, your Inner Champion will say you can. (Pause 5s) You will instinctively trust your abilities. You will know that you possess all the resources you need to succeed. (Pause 3s) You will approach new challenges with a sense of excitement and confidence. You will know that your Inner Champion is always there to support and guide you. (Pause 5s) You are becoming a person of unwavering self-belief. A person who embraces their full potential. (Pause 3s) When you are about to speak up in a meeting, you will feel your champion beside you. When you are about to try something new, you will feel their confidence in you. (Pause 5s) When someone criticises you, you will be able to consider the feedback without letting it define your worth. Your champion knows your value. (Pause 5s) See yourself tomorrow... taking an action you might once have avoided. You feel the doubt, and then you feel the champion. You act anyway. (Pause 3s) See yourself in a month... looking back at things you have done that you would not have attempted before. You will feel proud. You will feel capable. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of your Inner Champion. It will help you access that belief when you need it most. (Pause 5s) Self-doubt may still appear sometimes. That is normal. But now you have an ally. You have a voice that says: I believe in you. You can do this. (Pause 3s) You deserve to feel confident. You deserve to trust yourself. You have taken a powerful step today. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of self-belief fill you. Let it go with you when you open your eyes. You are capable. You are worthy. You have an Inner Champion. And that champion is you. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, when doubt whispers, you can answer with the voice of your champion. You can do this. I believe in you. You have what it takes. (Pause 5s) Hold on to this. You are becoming a person of unwavering self-belief. You are embracing your full potential. The arena is within you. The champion is within you. (Pause 3s) Trust yourself. You have earned that trust. You have survived every hard day. You have learned. You have grown. You are ready for whatever comes next. (Pause 5s) Let the doubt dissolve. Let the champion lead. You are capable. You are enough. You are ready. (Pause 3s) When you hear the voice of doubt, you can ask: is this helpful? Would my Inner Champion say this? (Pause 5s) If the answer is no, you can choose a different thought. You can remind yourself of your past successes. Your skills. Your resilience. (Pause 5s) You do not have to feel confident every moment. You only need to act. Action builds confidence. Each time you do something despite the doubt, you weaken the doubt and strengthen the champion. (Pause 5s) See yourself in a situation that used to trigger self-doubt. A presentation. A difficult conversation. A new project. (Pause 3s) This time, you feel the doubt, and you feel something else too: the presence of your Inner Champion. You take a breath. You proceed. (Pause 5s) You may not feel perfect. But you will feel proud that you did not let the doubt stop you. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received this training. It will bring the champion to mind when you need support. It will help you remember that you have overcome challenges before. (Pause 5s) You are not asking yourself to become someone else. You are allowing the part of you that already believes in you to take the lead. (Pause 3s) That part has always been there. It has seen you succeed. It has seen you survive. It has never stopped believing. (Pause 5s) So from this day forward, when self-doubt appears, you have a choice. You can listen to it and shrink. Or you can remember your Inner Champion and step forward. (Pause 5s) You are becoming a person who steps forward. You are embracing your full potential. The arena is within you. The champion is within you. (Pause 3s) Trust yourself. You have earned that trust. You are capable. You are enough. You are ready. (Pause 5s) Let this belief go with you. When you open your eyes, carry the champion with you. You can do this. You believe in you. (Pause 3s) And whenever you need a reminder, you can return to this arena. Your Inner Champion is always there. Always on your side. Always believing. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel confident. You deserve to trust yourself. You have taken a powerful step today. Honour it. Live it. You are ready. (Pause 3s) Doubt often comes from the past. From old messages. From times when you were criticised or when you failed. (Pause 5s) Your Inner Champion knows that the past does not define the future. You have learned. You have grown. You are not the same person you were then. (Pause 5s) Each time you act despite doubt, you send a new message to your subconscious: I can do this. I am capable. (Pause 3s) Over time, that message becomes stronger than the old one. The champion's voice becomes the default. (Pause 5s) You may still feel nervous before a big moment. That is normal. Nervousness is not the same as self-doubt. You can feel nervous and still believe in yourself. (Pause 5s) Your Inner Champion is not about never feeling afraid. It is about feeling afraid and acting anyway. (Pause 3s) So when you open your eyes and return to your day, carry the champion with you. When doubt appears, take a breath. Remember the arena. Remember who believes in you. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need. You have survived. You have learned. You have strengths. You have an Inner Champion. (Pause 3s) From this moment forward, your subconscious will support your self-belief. It will remind you of your capabilities. It will help you step forward even when the old voice says to hold back. (Pause 5s) You are becoming a person of unwavering self-belief. You are ready. Trust yourself. You have earned it. (Pause 3s) When you listen to this script again, the Inner Champion will feel more real. The arena will feel more like home. (Pause 5s) You are not trying to become arrogant. You are trying to become accurate. You have strengths. You have survived. You have what it takes. (Pause 5s) The doubt was never the full truth. It was a habit. A story. A voice that can be quieted. (Pause 3s) Your champion's voice is also true. You can do hard things. You have done them before. You will do them again. (Pause 5s) So carry this with you. When you open your eyes, carry the champion. When doubt appears, remember the arena. (Pause 3s) You are capable. You are enough. You are ready. Your Inner Champion believes in you. And that champion is part of you. (Pause 5s) Trust yourself. You have earned that trust. From this day forward, let the champion lead. You are ready. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received this training. It will bring your Inner Champion to mind when you need support. (Pause 5s) You do not have to feel confident every second. You only need to know that you can act. Action builds confidence. (Pause 3s) You have survived every difficult day so far. You have learned. You have grown. You have an Inner Champion who has never stopped believing in you. (Pause 5s) So trust yourself. You have earned it. You are capable. You are enough. You are ready. Carry the champion with you. You can do this. (Pause 3s) The arena and the champion are within you now. Whenever doubt appears, you can return to this place. (Pause 5s) You have what it takes. You have always had it. You are simply allowing yourself to believe it now. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, let your Inner Champion lead. You are capable. You are enough. You are ready. Trust yourself. You have earned that trust. (Pause 3s) Your Inner Champion has always been there. You have connected with that part of yourself today. (Pause 5s) From now on, when self-doubt speaks, you can answer with the champion's voice. You can do this. I believe in you. (Pause 3s) You are capable. You are enough. You are ready. Trust yourself. You have earned it. The arena is yours. (Pause 3s) So as we bring you back to full awareness, carry your Inner Champion with you. You believe in yourself. You can do this. (Pause 5s) You are capable. You are enough. You are ready. Trust yourself. The champion is with you always. Your subconscious will support your self-belief. You have earned this confidence. Trust yourself now. You are capable. You are ready. Believe it."
