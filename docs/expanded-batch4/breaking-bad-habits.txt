## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Release Valve

"Imagine a gentle, warm light in the centre of your chest. (Pause 3s) This light represents your true choice. Your freedom. (Pause 3s) Now imagine an old habit as a valve—a valve that has been holding in old energy. Old patterns. Old automatic responses. (Pause 5s) You reach for the valve. You are in control. You turn it. Slowly, the old habit energy begins to release. (Pause 5s) You feel it leaving. The pressure drops. The light in your chest grows brighter. (Pause 3s) You are not fighting the habit. You are simply releasing it. Making space for something new. (Pause 5s) The valve stays open. The old energy flows out. You feel lighter. You feel empowered. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling of release draw you deeper. The Release Valve is within you. You can use it whenever you choose to let go of a habit that no longer serves you."

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this calm state, feel a deep sense of empowerment over your habits. (Pause 3s) You recognise that habits are not who you are. They are patterns. Patterns that can be identified, understood, and changed. (Pause 5s) Any old belief that you are stuck with a bad habit simply dissolves. In its place, a calm sense of choice and possibility grows. (Pause 5s) Imagine yourself in a situation that used to trigger your old habit. You pause. You notice the trigger. You recognise it. (Pause 3s) Instead of the automatic response, you choose a new response. You feel the Release Valve. You let the old energy go. You choose something healthier. (Pause 5s) You understand that neural pathways can be rewired. Every time you choose the new response, you strengthen new pathways. The old ones weaken. (Pause 5s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to identify your triggers. You will notice when the old habit wants to activate. You will pause and choose. (Pause 3s) You will feel empowered because you know you are not your habits. You are the one who chooses. You can select healthier responses. (Pause 5s) When you feel the old pull, you can picture the Release Valve. You can breathe. You can ask yourself: what would my best self choose here? (Pause 5s) You are becoming a person who is free from habits that no longer serve you. A person who chooses. A person who is empowered. (Pause 3s) See yourself tomorrow... facing a trigger. You notice it. You pause. You choose the new response. You feel proud. (Pause 5s) See yourself next week... the old habit has less grip. You have chosen the new path several times. Your brain is learning. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... the bad habit is a memory. You have built new neural pathways. You make healthier choices naturally. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the Release Valve. It will help you choose the new response when the old habit tries to return. (Pause 5s) Breaking a bad habit is not about willpower alone. It is about awareness. It is about identifying triggers. It is about choosing new responses until they become automatic. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of empowerment sink in. You have the ability to change. You can identify triggers. You can choose new responses. (Pause 3s) The Release Valve and the light in your chest are within you. Whenever you need to remember, you can close your eyes and feel the release. (Pause 5s) You deserve to be free from habits that hold you back. You deserve to feel empowered. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, choice is your default. You are building a life of healthier responses. One choice at a time. (Pause 5s) Trust that when you identify triggers, you gain power. When you choose the new response, you rewire your brain. When you release the old energy, you make space for the new. (Pause 5s) In moments of temptation, you will pause. You will recognise the trigger. You will use the Release Valve. You will choose the healthier path. (Pause 5s) When you slip, you will not punish yourself. You will learn. You will try again. Every choice counts. (Pause 3s) When you succeed, you will acknowledge it. You will feel the empowerment. You will strengthen the new pathway. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious is now aligned with breaking bad habits. It will remind you of the Release Valve. It will remind you to pause and choose. It will help you select healthier responses. (Pause 3s) Let that truth settle in. You are a person who can change. You identify triggers. You choose new responses. You have this resource now. Use it well. (Pause 3s) The Release Valve is yours. It will never judge you. It will always be there when you choose to release the old and choose the new. (Pause 3s) When the old habit calls, you can turn the valve. When you feel the trigger, you can pause and breathe. When you want to give in, you can remember the light in your chest. (Pause 5s) Healthier choices are a gift you give yourself. They improve your life. They build your confidence. They prove you are in control. (Pause 5s) You may have believed that your habits controlled you. Now you know that you can control your response to triggers. (Pause 3s) Every time you choose the new response, you strengthen the new neural pathway. Your subconscious is learning: I can choose. I am not my habits. (Pause 5s) Triggers will still appear. But you no longer have to obey them. You can notice them and choose. (Pause 3s) Some days will still be challenging. Some moments will still test you. Your job is not to be perfect. Your job is to choose the new response more and more often. (Pause 5s) Each time you succeed, you prove to yourself that you can break this habit. That you are empowered. That change is possible. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the Release Valve. You have connected with empowerment. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body will remember. When the old habit knocks, you can answer with a breath. With the image of the valve. With the knowledge that you can choose. (Pause 3s) You deserve to feel this empowerment. You deserve to be free from habits that no longer serve you. The Release Valve is yours. Use it. Trust it. You are someone who chooses now. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen to this script again, the connection to the Release Valve will deepen. Your ability to break bad habits will grow. (Pause 5s) You are not becoming someone else. You are allowing a part of yourself that has always had the capacity for choice to take the lead. (Pause 3s) Many people feel trapped by habits. You are learning that you are the one in control. You have the Release Valve. (Pause 5s) The valve is yours. The light is yours. The feeling of empowerment is yours. (Pause 3s) So as you go back into your day, carry the Release Valve with you. When you feel the first flicker of the old habit, pause. Breathe. Remember the valve. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to break this habit. You have this experience. You have the image of the release. You have the choice, from now on, to select healthier responses. (Pause 3s) Let that truth guide you. You are empowered. You can identify triggers. You can choose. You are not your habits. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your journey to break bad habits in the days and weeks to come. (Pause 5s) When you are facing a strong trigger, you can return to this feeling. You can remember that you have the Release Valve. That you can choose. (Pause 5s) You deserve to move through life without being controlled by old patterns. You deserve the empowerment that choice brings. (Pause 3s) The Release Valve has awakened something in you. That awakening is permanent. You are a person who can break bad habits. Believe it. Live it. (Pause 5s) And whenever the old habit tries to pull you back, you can smile inwardly. You know another way. You know the Release Valve. You choose the new response. Again and again. You choose freedom. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of empowerment. The gift of the Release Valve. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body have learned something today. They will remember. When you need to release the old, you will know how. When you need to choose the new, you will do it. (Pause 3s) You are building a life of healthier choices. One response at a time. The Release Valve is within you. The light is always there. You have power. You are the one who chooses. You are free. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, let the Release Valve guide you. When you feel the trigger, picture the valve. When you feel the pull of the old habit, take a breath and choose. (Pause 5s) You have trained your mind for change. That training will stay with you. (Pause 3s) Honour this change. Use it. You deserve to be free from bad habits. The Release Valve is yours for life. (Pause 3s) And as we bring you back to full awareness, hold on to that feeling. You are empowered. You can identify triggers. You can choose new responses. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious will remind you. Whenever the old habit rises, you can return to the Release Valve. To the light. To the peace of choice. (Pause 3s) You are a person who can break bad habits. You have proven it to yourself today. Trust that. Live that. You have the valve. You choose. (Pause 3s) The Release Valve is part of you now. It will be there whenever you close your eyes and seek empowerment. (Pause 5s) You have taken an important step. You have connected with your power to choose. Let it guide you. Let it free you. You deserve this empowerment. You have earned it. The Release Valve is always with you. (Pause 3s) So go forward into your day with this power. With this choice. With the knowledge that you can break this habit. (Pause 5s) Your mind has received this training. It will support you. You are ready. You can choose. Believe it. (Pause 3s) You have the Release Valve. You have the light. Use them well. You are at ease with change. You are empowered. Always.

The valve is yours. Choice is your power. From this day forward. You are ready. You are free. Go in peace. Triggers are information. They show you where the old habit lived. Now you choose the new response. (Pause 3s) The Release Valve is always available. You are not your past choices. You are the one who chooses in this moment. (Pause 5s) Healthier choices become easier with every repetition. Your neural pathways are rewiring. You have the power. You have the light. (Pause 3s) Freedom from old habits is within your reach. You are reaching for it now."
