## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Connection Bridge

"Imagine yourself standing at the edge of a beautiful, sturdy bridge. (Pause 3s) The bridge stretches before you, connecting you to the other side—where your ideal client waits. (Pause 3s) You are not pushing. You are not selling. You are simply building connection. (Pause 5s) You take a step onto the bridge. It holds you. It is built on trust and understanding. With each step, you feel more confident. (Pause 5s) You see the person on the other side. You listen. You seek to understand their needs. The bridge grows stronger with every genuine exchange. (Pause 3s) You are not crossing to take something. You are crossing to offer value. To serve. To find the win-win. (Pause 5s) The connection between you and your client is real. It is built on respect. Let this feeling of authentic connection draw you deeper. The Connection Bridge is within you. You can walk it whenever you choose."

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this calm state, feel a deep sense of confidence in your ability to connect and serve. (Pause 3s) You recognise that sales, at its best, is not manipulation. It is service. It is listening. It is understanding what someone needs and offering a genuine solution. (Pause 5s) Any old patterns of fear of rejection, pushiness, or doubt simply dissolve. In their place, a calm sense of purpose and connection grows. (Pause 5s) Imagine yourself in a sales conversation. You are not anxious. You are curious. You ask questions. You listen to the answers. (Pause 3s) You understand the other person. You see how your product or service can genuinely help them. You speak with clarity and warmth. (Pause 5s) You know that rejection is not personal. It is simply a no to this offer at this time. You remain confident. You remain respectful. You seek win-win outcomes. (Pause 5s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to approach sales as service. You will instinctively listen before you speak. You will build rapport through genuine interest. (Pause 3s) You will overcome the fear of rejection because you know that every no brings you closer to a yes that fits. You will use ethical persuasion—helping people see value, not pressuring them. (Pause 5s) When you feel the old urge to push or the old fear of rejection, you can picture the bridge. You can breathe. You can ask yourself: how can I serve this person? (Pause 5s) You are becoming a person who sells with integrity. A person who connects. A person who creates wins for everyone. (Pause 3s) See yourself tomorrow... in a sales situation. You are calm. You listen. You respond with understanding. You offer value. (Pause 5s) See yourself next week... facing a difficult objection. Instead of fear, you feel curiosity. You ask another question. You find common ground. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... your confidence growing with every conversation. You know that connection is the foundation. You build it naturally. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the Connection Bridge. It will help you choose listening when the old habit of pushing tries to return. (Pause 5s) Ethical persuasion is not about tricking anyone. It is about presenting value clearly. It is about understanding. It is about creating outcomes where both sides benefit. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of confidence sink in. You have the ability to connect. You can listen. You can serve. You can persuade with integrity. (Pause 3s) The bridge and the connection are within you. Whenever you need to remember, you can close your eyes and see the sturdy bridge. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel confident in sales. You deserve to move through conversations without fear of rejection. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, connection is your default. You are building a practice of service-based sales. One conversation at a time. (Pause 5s) Trust that when you listen, you understand. When you understand, you can help. When you help, you create win-win. (Pause 5s) In every sales conversation, you will lead with curiosity. You will ask what the other person needs. You will listen more than you talk. (Pause 5s) When you face rejection, you will not take it personally. You will learn. You will move forward. You will stay confident. (Pause 3s) When you present your offer, you will do so with clarity and belief. You will focus on value. You will invite rather than pressure. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious is now aligned with sales as service. It will remind you of the bridge. It will remind you to connect. It will help you choose understanding over fear. (Pause 3s) Let that truth settle in. You are a person who sells with confidence and integrity. You connect. You serve. You create win-win. You have this resource now. Use it well. (Pause 3s) The Connection Bridge is yours. It will never collapse when you build it on genuine understanding. It will always remind you: connection first. Service always. (Pause 3s) When you feel nervous before a call, you can breathe and remember the bridge. When someone says no, you can thank them and move on. When you present, you can focus on their needs, not your fear. (Pause 5s) Sales confidence is a gift you give yourself. It reduces anxiety. It increases results. It makes you someone people trust. (Pause 5s) You may have believed that sales required aggression. Now you know that sales at its best requires connection. (Pause 3s) Every time you choose to listen and serve, you strengthen this new habit. Your subconscious is learning: I can connect. I can handle rejection. (Pause 5s) The world will still have people who say no. But you no longer have to fear it. You can accept it and move on. (Pause 3s) Some conversations will still be challenging. Some objections will still arise. Your job is not to win every time. Your job is to show up with confidence and integrity every time. (Pause 5s) Each time you succeed, you prove to yourself that connection works. That service sells. That you can do this. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the Connection Bridge. You have connected with confidence and service. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body will remember. When fear knocks, you can answer with a breath. With the image of the bridge. With the knowledge that you connect through service. (Pause 3s) You deserve to feel this confidence. You deserve to move through sales conversations without dread. The Connection Bridge is yours. Use it. Trust it. You sell with integrity now. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen to this script again, the connection to the bridge will deepen. Your capacity for confident, ethical persuasion will grow. (Pause 5s) You are not becoming someone else. You are allowing a part of yourself that has always had the capacity for connection to take the lead. (Pause 3s) Many people fear rejection. You are learning that rejection is simply redirection. You are building bridges. You are serving. (Pause 5s) The bridge is yours. The connection is yours. The feeling of confident service is yours. (Pause 3s) So as you go back into your day, carry the Connection Bridge with you. When you feel the first flicker of fear, pause. Breathe. Remember the bridge. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to sell with confidence. You have this experience. You have the image of the sturdy bridge. You have the choice, from now on, to connect and serve. (Pause 3s) Let that truth guide you. You are confident. You connect. You serve. Rejection cannot take that from you. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your sales confidence in the days and weeks to come. (Pause 5s) When you are facing a difficult client or a big pitch, you can return to this feeling. You can remember that listening builds trust. That service creates results. (Pause 5s) You deserve to move through your sales life without the constant weight of fear. You deserve the confidence that connection brings. (Pause 3s) The Connection Bridge has awakened something in you. That awakening is permanent. You are a person who sells with confidence and integrity. Believe it. Live it. (Pause 5s) And whenever doubt tries to return, you can smile inwardly. You know another way.
