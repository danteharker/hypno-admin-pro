## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Time Weaver

"Imagine yourself in a quiet, sunlit room. Before you stands an ancient loom. (Pause 3s) You are the Time Weaver. Each thread represents a part of your day—work, rest, relationships, creativity, health. (Pause 3s) You take the threads in your hands. They are not tangled. They flow smoothly. You choose which thread to weave next. (Pause 5s) You see a balanced tapestry forming. The pattern is clear. Nothing is rushed. Nothing is forgotten. Each thread finds its place. (Pause 5s) You feel a calm sense of control. You are not fighting time. You are shaping it. The loom responds to your intention. (Pause 3s) The tapestry grows—orderly, beautiful, balanced. You have all the time you need because you are the weaver. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling of mastery over your time draw you deeper. The Time Weaver is within you. You can return to this loom whenever you need to feel in control of your day."

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this calm state, feel a deep sense of clarity about how you use your time. (Pause 3s) You recognise that effective time management is not about doing more. It is about prioritising what truly matters. (Pause 5s) Any old patterns of overwhelm, procrastination, or scattered focus simply dissolve. In their place, a calm sense of purpose and order grows. (Pause 5s) Imagine yourself at the start of your day. You pause. You identify your most important tasks. You plan with intention. (Pause 3s) You focus on one thing at a time. You complete what matters before moving to the next. You feel a sense of accomplishment without exhaustion. (Pause 5s) You understand that planning is not rigid. It is flexible. It gives you structure so you can adapt when life shifts. You communicate your boundaries clearly. You say no when necessary. You protect time for rest and renewal. (Pause 5s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to prioritise. You will instinctively distinguish between urgent and important. (Pause 3s) You will reduce overwhelm by breaking large tasks into manageable steps. You will feel in control of your schedule rather than controlled by it. (Pause 5s) When you feel the old urge to rush or scatter your energy, you can picture the loom. You can breathe. You can ask yourself: what is the one thread I need to weave right now? (Pause 5s) You are becoming a person who manages time with ease. A person who achieves without burning out. (Pause 3s) See yourself tomorrow... starting your day with a few minutes of planning. You know your priorities. You focus. You accomplish what matters. (Pause 5s) See yourself next week... facing a busy period. Instead of overwhelm, you feel calm. You have a plan. You work through it step by step. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... your productivity rising because you prioritise well. You have balance. You have time for work, for rest, for the people you love. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the Time Weaver. It will help you choose focus when distraction calls. (Pause 5s) Effective time management is not selfish. It is essential. It allows you to show up fully. It reduces stress. It improves the quality of everything you do. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of order sink in. You have the ability to shape your days. You can plan. You can prioritise. You can maintain focus. (Pause 3s) The loom and the balanced tapestry are within you. Whenever you need to remember, you can close your eyes and see the threads flowing smoothly. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel in control. You deserve to move through your days without constant overwhelm. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, prioritising is your default. You are building a life of balance and productivity. One thread at a time. (Pause 5s) Trust that when you plan, you create space. When you focus, you achieve more with less effort. When you balance, you sustain your energy. (Pause 5s) In your work, you will set clear priorities. You will tackle the most important tasks when your energy is highest. You will limit distractions. (Pause 5s) In your personal life, you will protect time for what matters. You will schedule rest. You will be present when you are with others. (Pause 3s) When demands pile up, you will pause. You will reassess. You will choose what to do now and what can wait. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious is now aligned with effective time management. It will remind you of the loom. It will remind you to plan. It will help you choose focus over fragmentation. (Pause 3s) Let that truth settle in. You are a person who manages time well. You prioritise. You plan. You maintain balance. You have this resource now. Use it well. (Pause 3s) The Time Weaver is yours. The loom will never tangle when you approach it with intention. It will always remind you: you are in control. You can shape your day. (Pause 3s) When you have too much to do, you can list your tasks and choose the first priority. When you feel scattered, you can return to one thing. When others demand your time, you can honour your boundaries. (Pause 5s) Good time management is a gift you give yourself. It reduces anxiety. It increases satisfaction. It makes you someone who delivers and who also rests. (Pause 5s) You may have believed that being busy meant being productive. Now you know that being focused means being effective. (Pause 3s) Every time you choose to prioritise and plan, you strengthen this new habit. Your subconscious is learning: I can manage my time. I can stay focused. (Pause 5s) The world will still make demands. But you no longer have to say yes to everything. You can choose. (Pause 3s) Some days will still be full. Some tasks will still be challenging. Your job is not to do it all. Your job is to do what matters most. (Pause 5s) Each time you succeed, you prove to yourself that you can take control. That planning works. That focus brings results. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the Time Weaver. You have connected with clarity and control. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body will remember. When overwhelm knocks, you can answer with a breath. With the image of the loom. With the knowledge that you can prioritise. (Pause 3s) You deserve to feel this sense of order. You deserve to move through your days without constant rush. The Time Weaver is yours. Use it. Trust it. You manage time well now. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen to this script again, the connection to the loom will deepen. Your capacity for focus and balance will grow. (Pause 5s) You are not becoming someone else. You are allowing a part of yourself that has always had the capacity for order to take the lead. (Pause 3s) Many people react to time. You are learning to shape it. You are the weaver. The threads are in your hands. (Pause 5s) The loom is yours. The tapestry is yours. The feeling of calm control is yours. (Pause 3s) So as you go back into your day, carry the Time Weaver with you. When you feel the first flicker of overwhelm, pause. Breathe. Remember the loom. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to manage your time effectively. You have this experience. You have the image of the balanced tapestry. You have the choice, from now on, to prioritise and plan. (Pause 3s) Let that truth guide you. You are in control. You can focus. You can balance. There is enough time when you use it wisely. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your time management in the days and weeks to come.

(Pause 5s) You deserve to move through life without the constant pressure of chaos. You deserve the clarity that good time management brings. (Pause 3s) The Time Weaver has awakened something in you. That awakening is permanent. You are a person who manages time well. Believe it. Live it. (Pause 5s) And whenever the world tries to scatter your attention, you can smile inwardly.
