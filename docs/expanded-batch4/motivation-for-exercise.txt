## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Energy Flow

"Imagine a soft, vibrant light at the centre of your body. (Pause 3s) It is warm and alive. It is vitality itself. (Pause 3s) With each breath, this light grows brighter. It spreads through your chest, your arms, your legs. (Pause 5s) Your body is awakening to the possibility of movement. Not as a chore. As a celebration. (Pause 5s) You feel the energy flowing. Your muscles remember what it is to be used. To be strong. To be alive. (Pause 3s) The light pulses gently. You are connected to your physical self. You are ready to move. (Pause 5s) This is the Energy Flow. It is always there. It waits for you to choose activity. To choose life. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling of vibrant vitality draw you deeper. The Energy Flow is within you. You can return to it whenever you need motivation to move."

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this calm state, feel a deep sense of enthusiasm for movement awakening within you. (Pause 3s) You recognise that exercise is not a punishment. It is a celebration of what your body can do. It is a gift you give yourself. (Pause 5s) Any old patterns of seeing exercise as a chore, avoiding it, or feeling too tired simply dissolve. In their place, a genuine desire for movement and physical wellbeing grows. (Pause 5s) Imagine yourself choosing to move. Perhaps a walk. Perhaps a run. Perhaps a class or the gym. (Pause 3s) You feel enthusiasm. You feel your body responding. You enjoy the sensation of your heart pumping, your muscles working.

(Pause 3s) You will maintain consistency because you have connected exercise with joy, not duty. You will prioritise your physical wellbeing.

(Pause 5s) You are becoming a person who moves with joy. A person who celebrates their body. A person who enjoys physical activity. (Pause 3s) See yourself tomorrow... lacing up your shoes or stepping onto the mat. You feel eager. You begin. You enjoy the movement. (Pause 5s) See yourself next week... having moved several times. You feel stronger. You feel more energised. You look forward to the next session. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... exercise is part of your life. It is not a struggle. It is a pleasure. Your physical wellbeing has improved. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the Energy Flow. It will help you choose movement when the old habit of staying still tries to return. (Pause 5s) Exercise as celebration changes everything. It reduces stress. It boosts mood. It gives you more energy for the rest of your life. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of enthusiasm sink in. You have a body that wants to move. You can choose activity. You can enjoy it. (Pause 3s) The vibrant light and the Energy Flow are within you. Whenever you need to remember, you can close your eyes and feel the vitality. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel the joy of movement.

(Pause 5s) In your daily life, you will find yourself wanting to move. You will schedule it. You will protect it. You will feel good when you do it. (Pause 5s) When you feel tired, you will remember that movement often creates energy. You will start small. You will build from there. (Pause 3s) When you miss a session, you will not punish yourself. You will simply begin again. Consistency over perfection. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious is now aligned with exercise as celebration. It will remind you of the Energy Flow. It will remind you to move. It will help you choose enthusiasm over resistance. (Pause 3s) Let that truth settle in. You are a person who enjoys movement.

(Pause 3s) When you do not feel like exercising, you can remember the vibrant light. When you have had a long day, you can choose a gentle movement. When you have more energy, you can push a little more. (Pause 5s) Physical wellbeing is a gift you give yourself. It improves sleep. It sharpens mind. It makes you feel alive. (Pause 5s) You may have believed that exercise was something you had to force. Now you know it can be something you look forward to. (Pause 3s) Every time you choose to move, you strengthen this new habit. Your subconscious is learning: I enjoy movement. I can be consistent. (Pause 5s) The body will still have days when it feels heavy. But you no longer have to wait for perfect conditions. You can start. (Pause 3s) Some sessions will still be challenging. Some days you will prefer rest. Your job is not to be perfect. Your job is to move regularly and enjoy it. (Pause 5s) Each time you succeed, you prove to yourself that you can do this. That movement feels good. That consistency works. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the Energy Flow. You have connected with the joy of movement. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body will remember. When resistance knocks, you can answer with a breath. With the image of the vibrant light. With the knowledge that your body wants to move. (Pause 3s) You deserve to feel this enthusiasm. You deserve to experience the joy of physical activity. The Energy Flow is yours. Use it. Trust it.

(Pause 5s) You are not becoming someone else. You are allowing a part of yourself that has always had the capacity for vitality to take the lead. (Pause 3s) Many people see exercise as a duty. You are learning to see it as a celebration. You are reconnecting with the joy of movement. (Pause 5s) The vibrant light is yours. The Energy Flow is yours. The feeling of physical wellbeing is yours. (Pause 3s) So as you go back into your day, carry the Energy Flow with you. When you feel the first flicker of resistance, pause. Breathe. Remember the light. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to move with consistency and joy. You have this experience. You have the image of the vibrant light. You have the choice, from now on, to celebrate your body through movement. (Pause 3s) Let that truth guide you. You are enthusiastic. You are consistent. You enjoy exercise. Your body thanks you. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your motivation for exercise in the days and weeks to come.
