## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Blueprint of Change

"Imagine yourself in a quiet, well-lit workshop. (Pause 3s) On the table before you lies a blueprint—a plan for the new habit you wish to build. (Pause 3s) The blueprint shows clear steps. Small. Achievable. Each step leads to the next. (Pause 5s) You study the first step. It is simple. You could do it today. You feel a sense of possibility. (Pause 5s) You see yourself following the blueprint. Step one. Then step two. No rush. Just steady progress. (Pause 3s) The workshop is yours. The blueprint is yours. You have everything you need to build this new habit. (Pause 5s) With each small step, momentum grows. The blueprint becomes reality. You are the builder. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling of clear direction draw you deeper. The Blueprint of Change is within you. You can return to this workshop whenever you need to build something new."

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this calm state, feel a deep sense of possibility for building new habits. (Pause 3s) You recognise that lasting change does not happen in one leap. It happens through small, consistent steps. It requires patience. It builds momentum. (Pause 5s) Any old belief that you cannot change or that you lack discipline simply dissolves. In its place, a calm sense of capability and direction grows. (Pause 5s) Imagine yourself following your new habit. Perhaps it is a morning routine. Perhaps it is a skill. Perhaps it is a healthy behaviour. (Pause 3s) You take the first step. It is small. You complete it. You feel good. You take the next step. (Pause 5s) You understand that integrating new routines takes time. You are patient with yourself. You celebrate small wins. You keep going. (Pause 5s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to take the first step. You will instinctively break your goal into small, doable actions. You will build momentum through consistency. (Pause 3s) You will integrate new routines into your life because you have connected habit-building with patience and self-improvement. You will trust the process. (Pause 5s) When you feel the old doubt or the thought that it is too hard, you can picture the blueprint. You can breathe. You can ask yourself: what is the one small step I can take right now? (Pause 5s) You are becoming a person who builds new habits with ease. A person who takes small steps. A person who improves steadily. (Pause 3s) See yourself tomorrow... taking the first step from your blueprint. It is simple. You do it. You feel a sense of progress. (Pause 5s) See yourself next week... you have taken several steps. The new habit is taking shape. You feel momentum. You feel proud. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... the new habit is part of your life. It feels natural. It is integrated. You have changed. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the Blueprint of Change. It will help you take the next small step when resistance appears. (Pause 5s) Building new habits is not about perfection. It is about progress. It is about small, consistent steps. It is about patience and momentum. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of capability sink in. You have the ability to build new habits. You can take small steps. You can be patient. (Pause 3s) The blueprint and the workshop are within you. Whenever you need to remember, you can close your eyes and see the clear steps. (Pause 5s) You deserve to become the person you wish to be. You deserve to build habits that serve you. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, small steps are your default. You are building a life of self-improvement. One step at a time. (Pause 5s) Trust that when you take one step, you build momentum. When you are consistent, you integrate. When you are patient, you succeed. (Pause 5s) In your daily life, you will find yourself following your blueprint. You will take the next step. You will not wait for perfect conditions. (Pause 5s) When you miss a day, you will not give up. You will return to the blueprint. You will take the next step. (Pause 3s) When you feel impatient, you will remember that habits are built slowly. You will honour the process. You will keep going. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious is now aligned with building new habits. It will remind you of the blueprint. It will remind you to take the next step. It will help you choose consistency over perfection. (Pause 3s) Let that truth settle in. You are a person who can build new habits. You take small steps. You have patience. You have this resource now. Use it well. (Pause 3s) The Blueprint of Change is yours. It will never judge you for going slowly. It will always show you the next step. (Pause 3s) When you feel stuck, you can look at the blueprint. When you feel overwhelmed, you can focus on one step. When you succeed, you can acknowledge it and continue. (Pause 5s) Self-improvement is a gift you give yourself. It builds confidence. It creates lasting change. It proves you can grow. (Pause 5s) You may have believed that building habits was too hard. Now you know that small steps make it possible. (Pause 3s) Every time you take the next step, you strengthen the new habit. Your subconscious is learning: I can build habits. I can be consistent. (Pause 5s) The journey will still have ups and downs. But you no longer have to wait for motivation. You can take one step. (Pause 3s) Some days will still be challenging. Some steps will still feel difficult. Your job is not to be perfect. Your job is to take the next step and keep going. (Pause 5s) Each time you succeed, you prove to yourself that you can build this habit. That momentum works. That you are capable. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the Blueprint of Change. You have connected with possibility. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body will remember. When doubt knocks, you can answer with a breath. With the image of the blueprint. With the knowledge that you can take the next step.

(Pause 3s) Whenever you listen to this script again, the connection to the blueprint will deepen. Your ability to build new habits will grow. (Pause 5s) You are not becoming someone else. You are allowing a part of yourself that has always had the capacity for growth to take the lead. (Pause 3s) Many people want to change but do not know where to start. You have the blueprint. You have the steps. You have the workshop. (Pause 5s) The blueprint is yours. The workshop is yours. The feeling of steady progress is yours. (Pause 3s) So as you go back into your day, carry the Blueprint of Change with you. When you feel the first flicker of doubt, pause. Breathe. Remember the blueprint. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to build this new habit. You have this experience. You have the image of the clear steps. You have the choice, from now on, to take small, consistent steps. (Pause 3s) Let that truth guide you. You are capable. You can take the next step. You can be patient. You are building. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your habit-building in the days and weeks to come. (Pause 5s) When you are facing a difficult day, you can return to this feeling. You can remember that one small step is enough. That momentum builds. (Pause 5s) You deserve to move through life with the habits you choose. You deserve the self-improvement that consistency brings. (Pause 3s) The Blueprint of Change has awakened something in you. That awakening is permanent. You are a person who builds new habits. Believe it. Live it. (Pause 5s) And whenever the old voice says you cannot do it, you can smile inwardly. You know another way. You know the blueprint. You take the next step. Again and again. You choose growth. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of the blueprint. The gift of the Blueprint of Change. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body have learned something today. They will remember.

"Now, it is time to gently return to your full waking awareness, bringing with you all the positive feelings of capability, momentum, and steady progress.

One... beginning to feel a gentle energy returning to your body. You are safe and grounded.
