## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Gentle Embrace

"Imagine a soft, warm light surrounding you. It does not judge. It does not criticise. It simply holds you. (Pause 3s) This light is the essence of compassion. It flows from your own heart, wrapping around your shoulders like a gentle embrace. (Pause 3s) Feel how it accepts you exactly as you are. No conditions. No expectations. Just warmth and kindness. (Pause 5s) The light grows stronger with each breath. It fills your chest. It softens the places where you have been hard on yourself. (Pause 5s) You recognise that you deserve this kindness. The same kindness you would offer a dear friend. (Pause 3s) Any voice that says you are not good enough simply fades in this light. In its place, a quiet certainty: I am worthy of compassion. I can be gentle with myself. (Pause 5s) The gentle embrace holds you. It will always be here when you need it. You are learning to offer yourself the same care you give to others. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling draw you deeper. The gentle embrace is within you now. You can return to it whenever you need to remember that you deserve your own kindness."

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this space of soft light and warmth, feel a deep sense of self-compassion awakening within you. (Pause 3s) You recognise that being kind to yourself is not selfish. It is essential. (Pause 5s) Any old patterns of harsh self-criticism, perfectionism, or the belief that you must be hard on yourself to succeed simply dissolve and fade away. In their place, a profound sense of self-acceptance and gentleness grows. (Pause 5s) Imagine yourself in a moment when you would once have been critical. Perhaps you made a mistake. Perhaps you fell short of a goal. (Pause 3s) See yourself pausing. Placing a hand on your heart. Speaking to yourself as you would to someone you love. (Pause 5s) You understand that everyone struggles. Everyone falters. You are allowed to be human. You communicate with yourself using the same warmth and patience you would offer a friend. (Pause 5s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to cultivate self-compassion in all areas of your life. You will instinctively choose kindness over criticism. Understanding over blame. (Pause 3s) Your inner voice will become a supportive friend rather than a harsh judge. (Pause 5s) When you feel the old urge to berate yourself, you can picture the gentle embrace. You can breathe. You can ask yourself: what would I say to someone I love in this situation? (Pause 5s) You are becoming a person who treats themselves with profound compassion. A source of warmth for your own soul. (Pause 3s) See yourself tomorrow... in a moment that would once have triggered self-criticism. This time, you pause. You offer yourself kindness. You respond with compassion. (Pause 5s) See yourself next week... facing a setback or a disappointment. Instead of attacking yourself, you feel a quiet acceptance. You remind yourself that you are doing your best. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... your relationship with yourself improving because you are no longer your own worst critic. You give yourself the gift of the gentle embrace. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the soft light. It will help you choose self-compassion when the old habit of self-criticism tries to return. (Pause 5s) Self-compassion is not self-indulgence. It is a powerful choice. It restores your energy. It improves your resilience. It allows you to learn from mistakes without being destroyed by them. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of self-compassion sink in. You deserve to be treated with kindness. Especially by yourself. (Pause 3s) The gentle embrace is within you. Whenever you need to remember, you can close your eyes and feel the warm light surrounding you. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel accepted. You deserve to be your own ally. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, self-compassion is your default. You are building a life of inner warmth and self-acceptance. One kind word at a time. (Pause 5s) Trust that you are enough. Trust that you do not need to be perfect to be worthy of love and kindness. (Pause 5s) In difficult moments, you will find yourself speaking to yourself with gentleness. Not denying the difficulty. Not pretending everything is fine. Simply offering yourself the same comfort you would offer another. (Pause 3s) At work, you will acknowledge your efforts. You will recognise that one setback does not define you. You will allow yourself to rest when you need it. (Pause 5s) With yourself, you will be patient. You will not hold yourself to impossible standards. You will celebrate small progress. (Pause 5s) When you feel ashamed or inadequate, you will pause before spiralling. You will ask: would I treat a friend this way? Usually the answer is no. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious is now aligned with self-compassion. It will remind you of the gentle embrace. It will remind you to be kind. It will help you choose the warmer, more supportive response. (Pause 3s) Let that truth settle in. You are worthy of your own compassion. You are learning to hold yourself with gentleness. You have this resource now. Use it well. (Pause 3s) The gentle embrace is yours. It will never judge. It will always remind you: you are enough. You deserve kindness. You are human. (Pause 3s) When you are tired, you can offer yourself rest. When you are struggling, you can offer yourself understanding. When you have failed at something, you can offer yourself the chance to try again without cruelty. (Pause 5s) Self-compassion is a gift you give yourself. It reduces anxiety. It improves your relationship with yourself. It makes you more able to show up for others because you are not depleted by self-attack. (Pause 5s) You may have been told that being hard on yourself is necessary. Now you are learning that being kind to yourself is more effective. (Pause 3s) Every time you choose to speak to yourself with warmth instead of harshness, you strengthen this new habit. Your subconscious is learning: I can be gentle with myself. I deserve compassion. (Pause 5s) The world may still be critical. But you no longer have to join in. You can be your own safe place. (Pause 3s) Some people will still have opinions. Some situations will still be difficult. Your job is not to please everyone. Your job is to treat yourself with respect and kindness. (Pause 5s) Each time you offer yourself the gentle embrace, you prove to yourself that self-compassion is possible. That you can do this. That the old critical pattern is losing its grip. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the gentle embrace. You have connected with self-compassion. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body will remember. When self-criticism knocks, you can answer with a breath. With the image of the soft light. With the knowledge that you deserve kindness. (Pause 3s) You deserve to feel this warmth. You deserve to be your own friend. The gentle embrace is yours. Use it. Trust it. You are a compassionate person towards yourself now. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen to this script again, the connection to the gentle embrace will deepen. Your capacity for self-compassion will grow. (Pause 5s) You are not becoming someone else. You are allowing a part of yourself that has always had the capacity for kindness to extend that kindness to you. (Pause 3s) We often find it easier to be compassionate towards others. You are learning to include yourself in that circle of care. (Pause 5s) The soft light is yours. The gentle embrace is yours. The feeling of self-acceptance is yours. (Pause 3s) So as you go back into your day, carry the gentle embrace with you. When you feel the first flicker of self-criticism, pause. Breathe. Remember the warm light. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to be compassionate towards yourself. You have this experience. You have the image of the gentle embrace. You have the choice, from now on, to treat yourself with kindness. (Pause 3s) Let that truth guide you. You are worthy. You are enough. You deserve your own compassion. There is no need to wait until you are perfect. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your self-compassion in the days and weeks to come. (Pause 5s) When you are struggling, when you have made a mistake, or when you feel inadequate, you can return to this feeling. You can remember that the gentle embrace is always available. (Pause 5s) You deserve to move through life without the constant weight of self-criticism. You deserve the warmth that self-compassion brings. (Pause 3s) The gentle embrace has opened something in you. That opening is permanent. You are learning to be kind to yourself. Believe it. Live it. (Pause 5s) And whenever the inner critic tries to speak, you can respond with the gentle embrace. You know another way. You know the way of self-compassion. You choose kindness. Again and again. You choose yourself. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of self-compassion. The gift of the gentle embrace. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body have learned something today. They will remember. When you need to be kind to yourself, you will know how. When you need to hold yourself with gentleness, you will do it. (Pause 3s) You are building a life of self-acceptance. One compassionate moment at a time. The gentle embrace is within you. The soft light is always available. You are worthy. You are kind to yourself. You are free. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, let the gentle embrace guide you. When you feel the urge to criticise yourself, picture the warm light. When you feel unworthy, take a breath and offer yourself kindness. (Pause 5s) You have trained your mind for self-compassion. That training will stay with you. (Pause 3s) Honour this change. Use it. You deserve to live without constant self-attack. The gentle embrace is yours for life. (Pause 3s) And as we bring you back to full awareness, hold on to that feeling. You are worthy of kindness. You can be gentle with yourself. You do not need to be perfect. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious will remind you. Whenever self-criticism rises, you can return to the gentle embrace. To the soft light. To the peace of self-acceptance. (Pause 3s) You are a person who treats themselves with compassion. You have proven it to yourself today. Trust that. Live that. You are enough. You deserve kindness. You choose self-compassion. (Pause 3s) The gentle embrace is part of you now. It will be there whenever you close your eyes and seek warmth. (Pause 5s) You have taken an important step. You have connected with self-compassion. Let it guide you. Let it ease your relationship with yourself. You deserve this kindness. You have always deserved it. The gentle embrace is always with you. (Pause 3s) So go forward into your day with this warmth. With this self-compassion. With the knowledge that you can be kind to yourself. (Pause 5s) Your mind has received this training. It will support you. You are ready. You are compassionate towards yourself. Believe it. (Pause 3s) You have the gentle embrace. You have self-compassion. Use them well. You are worthy. You are enough. Always. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious holds the image of the gentle embrace. It will remind you to be kind to yourself. You are worthy of your own compassion. Trust yourself. You have this now. The soft light is yours. Self-compassion is your choice. From this day forward. You are ready. You are kind to yourself. Go in peace."
