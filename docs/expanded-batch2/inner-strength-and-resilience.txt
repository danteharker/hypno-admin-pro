## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Ancient Oak

"Imagine yourself standing before a great ancient oak tree. Its trunk is broad and solid. Its branches reach high into the sky. (Pause 3s) You notice its roots. Deep beneath the earth, they spread wide and far. They have held this tree through decades of storms. (Pause 3s) You place your hands on the rough bark. You feel the strength. The steadiness. The quiet power of something that has weathered every season. (Pause 5s) The wind may blow. The rain may fall. The oak does not break. It bends when it must. It stands when it can. (Pause 5s) You feel that same strength rising within you. From your feet, as if roots are growing down into the earth. From your spine, as if you are the trunk. (Pause 3s) Storms have come and gone in your life. You are still here. You have the same capacity to endure. To recover. To grow stronger through difficulty. (Pause 5s) The ancient oak teaches you that strength is not the absence of challenge. It is the ability to stand through it. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling draw you deeper. The ancient oak is within you now. You can return to it whenever you need to remember your inner strength and resilience."

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in the presence of this ancient oak, feel a deep sense of inner strength and resilience awakening within you. (Pause 3s) You recognise that you have already survived every difficult moment of your life. You have the capacity to endure and to thrive. (Pause 5s) Any old patterns of giving up too soon, doubting your ability to cope, or feeling that you are too fragile simply dissolve and fade away. In their place, a profound sense of steadiness and capability grows. (Pause 5s) Imagine yourself in a situation that would once have overwhelmed you. Perhaps a setback. Perhaps a loss. Perhaps a period of great pressure. (Pause 3s) See yourself pausing. Feeling your feet on the ground. Drawing on the strength of the oak. Responding with calm and determination. (Pause 5s) You understand that difficulty does not define you. How you respond to it does. You communicate with yourself and others from a place of grounded strength. You maintain your centre even when the winds blow. (Pause 5s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to access your inner strength in all areas of your life. You will instinctively choose resilience over collapse. Persistence over surrender. (Pause 3s) Your inner resources will be more available to you. You will remember that you have weathered storms before. (Pause 5s) When you feel the old urge to give up or fall apart, you can picture the ancient oak. You can breathe. You can ask yourself: what would the oak do here? It would stand. It would endure. (Pause 5s) You are becoming a person of profound resilience. A source of steadiness in an uncertain world. (Pause 3s) See yourself tomorrow... in a moment that would once have shaken you. This time, you feel your roots. You stand. You respond with strength. (Pause 5s) See yourself next week... facing a challenge or a disappointment. Instead of crumbling, you feel a quiet determination. You use the difficulty to grow stronger. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... your capacity for resilience deepening because you are no longer afraid of storms. You know you can bend and not break. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the ancient oak. It will help you choose resilience when the old habit of giving up tries to return. (Pause 5s) Resilience is not the absence of pain. It is the ability to recover. To adapt. To find your feet again after a fall. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of inner strength sink in. You have survived. You will survive. You have the oak within you. (Pause 3s) The ancient oak is within you. Whenever you need to remember, you can close your eyes and feel the roots beneath you, the trunk steady and strong. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel capable. You deserve to trust in your own resilience. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, inner strength is your default. You are building a life of steadiness and recovery. One breath at a time. (Pause 5s) Trust that you can handle what comes. Trust that storms pass and you remain. (Pause 5s) In difficult moments, you will find yourself grounding. Feeling your feet. Drawing on the strength you have always had. (Pause 3s) At work, you will meet deadlines and setbacks with calm. You will not be destroyed by one failure. You will get up and try again. (Pause 5s) In relationships, you will maintain your boundaries. You will not lose yourself in the winds of others' emotions. You will stand firm when necessary. (Pause 5s) When you feel like giving up, you will pause before surrendering. You will ask: have I survived worse? Usually the answer is yes. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious is now aligned with resilience. It will remind you of the ancient oak. It will remind you to stand. It will help you choose the steadier, more enduring response. (Pause 3s) Let that truth settle in. You are resilient. You are strong. You have this resource now. Use it well. (Pause 3s) The ancient oak is yours. It will not break. It will always remind you: you can endure. You can recover. You are strong. (Pause 3s) When the wind blows, you can bend. When the storm passes, you can stand tall again. When you are tired, you can rest without believing you have failed. (Pause 5s) Resilience is a gift you give yourself. It reduces fear. It improves your ability to take on challenges. It makes you someone who can be counted on. (Pause 5s) You may have been told that you are fragile. Now you are remembering that you are like the oak. You have roots. You have strength. (Pause 3s) Every time you choose to stand rather than collapse, you strengthen this new habit. Your subconscious is learning: I can handle this. I am resilient. (Pause 5s) The world will still bring storms. But you no longer have to be destroyed by them. You can weather them. (Pause 3s) Some challenges will still be hard. Some days will still feel long. Your job is not to avoid all difficulty. Your job is to meet it with the strength of the oak. (Pause 5s) Each time you endure and recover, you prove to yourself that resilience is possible. That you can do this. That the old pattern of giving up is losing its grip. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the ancient oak. You have connected with your inner strength. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body will remember. When overwhelm or despair knock, you can answer with a breath. With the image of the oak. With the knowledge that you have endured before. (Pause 3s) You deserve to feel this strong. You deserve to trust in your resilience. The ancient oak is yours. Use it. Trust it. You are a resilient person now. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen to this script again, the connection to the ancient oak will deepen. Your capacity for resilience will grow. (Pause 5s) You are not becoming someone else. You are allowing a part of yourself that has always had the capacity for strength to take the lead. (Pause 3s) Trees do not run from storms. They stand. They have learned, over time, that they can survive. You are learning the same. (Pause 5s) The oak is yours. The roots are yours. The feeling of unshakeable strength is yours. (Pause 3s) So as you go back into your day, carry the ancient oak with you. When you feel the first flicker of wanting to give up, pause. Breathe. Remember the tree. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to be resilient. You have this experience. You have the image of the ancient oak. You have the choice, from now on, to stand through difficulty. (Pause 3s) Let that truth guide you. You are strong. You can endure. You have roots. There is nothing you cannot survive. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your resilience in the days and weeks to come. (Pause 5s) When you are in the middle of a storm, when you have fallen, or when you feel exhausted, you can return to this feeling. You can remember that the oak has weathered every season. (Pause 5s) You deserve to move through life without the constant fear of breaking. You deserve the steadiness that resilience brings. (Pause 3s) The ancient oak has opened something in you. That opening is permanent. You are a resilient person. Believe it. Live it.

You choose strength. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of inner strength. The gift of the ancient oak. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body have learned something today. They will remember. When you need to stand, you will know how. When you need to endure, you will do it. (Pause 3s) You are building a life of resilience. One steady moment at a time. The ancient oak is within you. The roots are always there. You are strong. You are resilient. You are free. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, let the ancient oak guide you. When you feel like collapsing, picture the tree.
