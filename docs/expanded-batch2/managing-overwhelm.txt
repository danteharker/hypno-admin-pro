## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Calm Command Centre

"Imagine yourself in a quiet, spacious room. In the centre is a single desk. On the desk are several screens. (Pause 3s) Each screen shows one task. One responsibility. One item that needs your attention. Nothing is flashing. Nothing is urgent. Everything is simply there, in order. (Pause 3s) You are the operator of this command centre. You are calm. You are in control. You decide what to look at next. (Pause 5s) You take a breath. You choose one screen. You focus on it. The others wait. They do not demand. They do not overwhelm. (Pause 5s) You complete what you can. You set aside what can wait. The room stays quiet. The order stays clear. (Pause 3s) You recognise that you do not have to do everything at once. You can handle one thing at a time. The calm command centre is your mind when it is organised. When it is at peace. (Pause 5s) Any sense of chaos or overload simply fades. In its place, a quiet certainty: I can prioritise. I can focus. I am in control. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling draw you deeper. The calm command centre is within you now. You can return to it whenever you need to remember that overwhelm can become order."

## Therapeutic Content

"Now, in this calm command centre, feel a deep sense of order and control awakening within you. (Pause 3s) You recognise that overwhelm is a feeling, not a fact. You can manage your tasks. You can manage your mind. (Pause 5s) Any old patterns of feeling paralysed by too much to do, of rushing in panic, or of believing you cannot cope simply dissolve and fade away. In their place, a profound sense of clarity and capability grows. (Pause 5s) Imagine yourself in a moment when you would once have felt overwhelmed. Perhaps a long to-do list. Perhaps multiple demands. Perhaps a deadline approaching. (Pause 3s) See yourself pausing. Taking a breath. Returning to the calm command centre. Choosing one screen. One task. (Pause 5s) You understand that you do not have to do everything at once. You can prioritise. You can break things down. You can ask for help or extend a deadline when needed. (Pause 5s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to manage overwhelm in all areas of your life. You will instinctively choose focus over chaos. One step at a time over everything at once. (Pause 3s) Your mind will default to the calm command centre when stress rises. You will remember that order is possible. (Pause 5s) When you feel the old urge to panic or freeze, you can picture the screens. You can breathe. You can ask yourself: what is the one thing I can do right now? (Pause 5s) You are becoming a person who manages overwhelm with calm and clarity. A source of order in a busy world. (Pause 3s) See yourself tomorrow... in a moment that would once have triggered overwhelm. This time, you pause. You return to the command centre. You choose one task. (Pause 5s) See yourself next week... facing a busy period or a pile of responsibilities. Instead of spiralling, you feel a quiet focus. You work through things in order. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... your capacity to handle pressure improving because you are no longer drowning in the feeling of too much. You know how to create order. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the calm command centre. It will help you choose focus when the old habit of overwhelm tries to return. (Pause 5s) Managing overwhelm is not about doing more. It is about thinking clearly. Prioritising. Taking one step at a time. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of order sink in. You can handle what is on your plate. You can create calm. You have the command centre within you. (Pause 3s) The calm command centre is within you. Whenever you need to remember, you can close your eyes and see the screens. One task at a time. (Pause 5s) You deserve to feel in control. You deserve to work without constant panic. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, calm focus is your default when things pile up. You are building a life of order and clarity. One task at a time. (Pause 5s) Trust that you can prioritise. Trust that not everything is urgent. (Pause 5s) In busy moments, you will find yourself pausing before reacting. Taking a breath. Choosing what to do first. (Pause 3s) At work, you will use lists. You will set boundaries. You will say no when you need to. You will delegate when you can. (Pause 5s) At home, you will break large tasks into smaller ones. You will not try to do everything in one go. You will celebrate progress. (Pause 5s) When you feel the first signs of overwhelm, you will stop. You will ask: what is the one thing I can do right now? Usually that one thing is enough to start. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious is now aligned with order. It will remind you of the calm command centre. It will remind you to focus. It will help you choose the calmer, more organised response. (Pause 3s) Let that truth settle in. You can manage overwhelm. You are learning to create order. You have this resource now. Use it well. (Pause 3s) The calm command centre is yours. It will not shout. It will always remind you: one thing at a time. You can prioritise. You are in control. (Pause 3s) When the list is long, you can choose the first item. When the demands are many, you can focus on one. When you feel scattered, you can return to the centre. (Pause 5s) Managing overwhelm is a gift you give yourself. It reduces anxiety. It improves your productivity. It allows you to complete things instead of spinning. (Pause 5s) You may have believed that busy means chaotic. Now you are learning that busy can be orderly. That you can be in control. (Pause 3s) Every time you choose to focus on one thing instead of everything, you strengthen this new habit. Your subconscious is learning: I can prioritise. I can handle this. (Pause 5s) The world will still send many demands. But you no longer have to receive them all at once. You can sort them. You can choose. (Pause 3s) Some days will still be full. Some weeks will still be intense. Your job is not to do everything at once. Your job is to work from the calm command centre. One screen at a time. (Pause 5s) Each time you pause and prioritise, you prove to yourself that overwhelm can be managed. That you can do this. That the old pattern of panic is losing its grip. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the calm command centre. You have connected with order. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body will remember. When overwhelm knocks, you can answer with a breath. With the image of the screens. With the question: what is the one thing I can do now? (Pause 3s) You deserve to feel this calm. You deserve to work without constant overload. The calm command centre is yours. Use it. Trust it. You are a person who manages overwhelm now. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen to this script again, the connection to the calm command centre will deepen. Your capacity for order will grow. (Pause 5s) You are not becoming someone else. You are allowing a part of yourself that has always had the capacity for focus to take the lead. (Pause 3s) Pilots have many instruments. They focus on one at a time. You can do the same with your tasks. (Pause 5s) The command centre is yours. The screens are yours. The feeling of calm control is yours. (Pause 3s) So as you go back into your day, carry the calm command centre with you. When you feel the first flicker of overwhelm, pause. Breathe. Remember the screens. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to manage overwhelm. You have this experience. You have the image of the calm command centre. You have the choice, from now on, to focus one task at a time. (Pause 3s) Let that truth guide you. You can prioritise. You can focus. You are in control. There is always one thing you can do next. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your ability to manage overwhelm in the days and weeks to come. (Pause 5s) When you are drowning in tasks, when you feel scattered, or when pressure builds, you can return to this feeling. You can remember that the command centre is always available. (Pause 5s) You deserve to move through life without constant overload. You deserve the clarity that order brings. (Pause 3s) The calm command centre has opened something in you. That opening is permanent. You are learning to manage overwhelm. Believe it. Live it. (Pause 5s) And whenever chaos tries to take over, you can respond with the command centre. You know another way. You know the way of one thing at a time. You choose order. Again and again. You choose focus. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of order. The gift of the calm command centre. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body have learned something today. They will remember. When you need to prioritise, you will know how. When you need to focus, you will do it. (Pause 3s) You are building a life of calm and control. One task at a time. The calm command centre is within you. The screens are always there. You can prioritise. You can focus. You are free. (Pause 3s) From this day forward, let the calm command centre guide you. When you feel overwhelmed, picture the screens. When you feel scattered, take a breath and choose one thing. (Pause 5s) You have trained your mind for order. That training will stay with you. (Pause 3s) Honour this change. Use it. You deserve to work without constant overload. The calm command centre is yours for life. (Pause 3s) And as we bring you back to full awareness, hold on to that feeling. You can manage overwhelm. You can prioritise. You do not need to do everything at once. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious will remind you. Whenever overload rises, you can return to the calm command centre. To the screens. To the peace of one thing at a time. (Pause 3s) You are a person who manages overwhelm. You have proven it to yourself today. Trust that. Live that. You can focus. You can prioritise. You choose order. (Pause 3s) The calm command centre is part of you now. It will be there whenever you close your eyes and seek clarity. (Pause 5s) You have taken an important step. You have connected with order. Let it guide you. Let it ease your busy days. You deserve this calm. You have always had the capacity for it. The calm command centre is always with you. (Pause 3s) So go forward into your day with this order. With this focus. With the knowledge that you can manage what comes. (Pause 5s) Your mind has received this training. It will support you. You are ready. You can manage overwhelm. Believe it. (Pause 3s) You have the calm command centre. You have order. Use them well. You can prioritise. You can focus. Always. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious holds the image of the calm command centre. It will remind you to focus on one thing. You can manage overwhelm. Trust yourself. You have this now. The screens are yours. Order is your choice. From this day forward. You are ready. You are in control. Go in peace."

## Termination

"Now, it is time to gently return to your full waking awareness, bringing with you all the positive feelings of order, clarity, and calm control. (Pause 3s) I will count from one to five, and with each number, you will feel more and more alert, refreshed, and ready to engage with your day.

One... beginning to feel a gentle energy returning to your body. You are safe and grounded.
Two... becoming more aware of your surroundings, feeling grounded and present in the room.
