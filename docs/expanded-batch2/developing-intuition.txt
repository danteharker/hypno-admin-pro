## Induction - Progressive Relaxation

"As you settle into a comfortable position, allow your eyes to gently close. (Pause 3s) Take a deep, calming breath in through your nose... and as you exhale slowly through your mouth, release any tension you might be holding in your shoulders or your jaw. (Pause 3s) Continue to breathe deeply and evenly, allowing each breath to carry you deeper into relaxation. With every out-breath, you let go a little more. With every in-breath, you invite calm and stillness. (Pause 5s)

Bring your awareness to your feet. Notice the weight of your feet resting on the floor or the surface beneath you. Feel your toes relaxing... each toe letting go of any tension. Feel the soles of your feet becoming soft and heavy. Feel your heels sinking... your ankles releasing. (Pause 3s) Let this wave of relaxation move slowly up through your calves, your shins, and your knees. Your legs feel heavy and relaxed, as if they are gently melting into the support beneath you. (Pause 5s)

Feel your thighs relaxing, becoming soft and loose. This soothing sensation continues into your hips and your lower back, releasing any stiffness or holding. Your abdomen softens... your stomach muscles letting go completely. Your chest relaxes with each gentle breath. (Pause 3s) Feel the relaxation spreading up your spine, vertebra by vertebra... through your shoulders, and down your arms to your elbows, your forearms, your wrists, and your fingertips. Your arms are loose and heavy. (Pause 5s)

Your neck relaxes... your jaw unclenches... your tongue rests gently in your mouth... your facial muscles soften... your forehead is smooth and calm. Your eyelids feel wonderfully heavy. (Pause 3s) You are now deeply relaxed, peaceful, and calm. Your whole body feels supported. Your mind is becoming still. (Pause 5s) Every time you breathe out, you go a little deeper. Deeper and deeper into this safe, comfortable state of relaxation. Nothing can disturb you here. You are safe. You are at ease. (Pause 5s)"

## Deepener - The Inner Compass

"Imagine a soft, steady light glowing in the centre of your chest. It is not bright or harsh. It is gentle. It is yours. (Pause 3s) This light is your inner compass. It has always been there. It knows the way when your mind is clouded by doubt or noise. (Pause 3s) You place your attention on this light. You feel it warm. You feel it calm. It does not shout. It does not rush. It simply points. (Pause 5s) When you have made good decisions in the past, this light was there. When you have felt a quiet yes or no in your belly, this light was speaking. (Pause 5s) You recognise that you have access to inner wisdom. You do not need everyone else's opinion. You can tune in to your own knowing. (Pause 3s) The inner compass is not logic. It is not analysis. It is something deeper. A sense. A pull. A quiet certainty. (Pause 5s) Any voice that says you cannot trust yourself simply fades in this light. In its place, a quiet certainty: I have guidance within. I can listen. I can trust my inner wisdom. (Pause 5s) The inner compass will always point you towards what is right for you. You are learning to hear it. To follow it. (Pause 5s) Let this feeling draw you deeper. The inner compass is within you now. You can return to it whenever you need guidance or clarity."

"Now, in the presence of this inner light, feel a deep sense of intuition and inner wisdom awakening within you. (Pause 3s) You recognise that you have always had access to guidance. You can trust the quiet voice within. (Pause 5s) Any old patterns of doubting yourself, ignoring your gut feeling, or always seeking external validation simply dissolve and fade away. In their place, a profound sense of inner knowing and trust grows. (Pause 5s) Imagine yourself in a moment when you need to make a decision. Perhaps a choice about work. Perhaps a relationship. Perhaps a path forward. (Pause 3s) See yourself pausing. Placing your hand on your chest. Feeling the light of the inner compass. Listening. (Pause 5s) You understand that your body and your deeper mind hold wisdom that logic alone cannot provide. You can honour that wisdom. You can act on it with confidence. (Pause 5s) From this moment forward, you will find it easier to access your intuition in all areas of your life. You will instinctively pause to listen. To feel. To check in with your inner compass. (Pause 3s) Your inner wisdom will become a trusted guide. You will recognise the difference between fear and intuition. Between wishful thinking and genuine knowing. (Pause 5s) When you feel confused or unsure, you can picture the light in your chest. You can breathe. You can ask yourself: what does my inner compass say? (Pause 5s) You are becoming a person who trusts their intuition. A source of guidance from within. (Pause 3s) See yourself tomorrow... in a moment that would once have left you paralysed by doubt. This time, you pause. You feel the light. You listen. You choose with confidence. (Pause 5s) See yourself next week... facing a decision that matters. Instead of seeking endless opinions, you feel a quiet pull. You honour it. You act on it. (Pause 5s) See yourself in the months to come... your relationship with your inner wisdom deepening because you are no longer overriding it. You give yourself the gift of listening. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will remind you of the inner compass. It will help you choose to listen when the old habit of doubt tries to return. (Pause 5s) Intuition is not magic. It is the wisdom of your whole self. Your body. Your experience. Your deeper mind. It can be developed and trusted. (Pause 5s) So let this feeling of inner guidance sink in. You have an inner compass. You can learn to read it. You can follow it. (Pause 3s) The inner compass is within you. Whenever you need to remember, you can close your eyes and feel the light in your chest. (Pause 5s) You deserve to trust yourself. You deserve to have a reliable inner guide.

(Pause 5s) Trust that you have the answers within. Trust that your inner compass will point you towards what is right for you. (Pause 5s) In moments of choice, you will find yourself pausing. Breathing. Placing your attention on your chest. Asking: what do I sense here? (Pause 3s) At work, you will honour your instincts about people and projects. You will not dismiss a gut feeling as irrational. You will give it space to speak. (Pause 5s) In relationships, you will notice when something feels right or wrong. You will not talk yourself out of your own knowing. You will act with integrity to your inner guidance. (Pause 5s) When you feel pulled in two directions, you will pause before deciding. You will ask: what does my inner compass say? And you will listen. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious is now aligned with intuition. It will remind you of the inner compass. It will remind you to listen. It will help you choose the path that resonates with your deeper wisdom. (Pause 3s) Let that truth settle in. You have inner wisdom. You are learning to trust it. You have this resource now. Use it well. (Pause 3s) The inner compass is yours. It will not leave. It will always remind you: you have guidance within. You can trust yourself. You know more than you think. (Pause 3s) When you are at a crossroads, you can feel the light. When you are unsure, you can ask and wait for the quiet answer. When others disagree, you can still honour what you sense. (Pause 5s) Intuition is a gift you give yourself. It reduces anxiety about decisions. It improves your alignment with your true path. It makes you someone who can act with confidence. (Pause 5s) You may have been told that you must have a reason for everything. Now you are learning that sometimes the reason is a feeling. A knowing. A pull. (Pause 3s) Every time you choose to listen to your inner compass instead of overriding it, you strengthen this new habit. Your subconscious is learning: I can trust my intuition. I have guidance within. (Pause 5s) The world will still offer opinions. But you no longer have to be ruled by them. You can consult your inner compass first. (Pause 3s) Some decisions will still be hard. Some answers will still take time. Your job is not to have certainty from the outside. Your job is to listen to the wisdom within. (Pause 5s) Each time you follow your intuition and it serves you, you prove to yourself that you can trust it. That you have this capacity. That the old pattern of doubt is losing its grip. (Pause 5s) So hold on to this feeling as we prepare to bring you back. You have connected with the inner compass. You have connected with your intuition. (Pause 5s) Your mind and body will remember. When doubt or confusion knock, you can answer with a breath. With the image of the light in your chest. With the question: what does my inner compass say? (Pause 3s) You deserve to feel this guided. You deserve to trust your own wisdom. The inner compass is yours. Use it. Trust it. You are a person who listens to intuition now. (Pause 3s) Whenever you listen to this script again, the connection to the inner compass will deepen. Your capacity for intuition will grow. (Pause 5s) You are not becoming someone else. You are allowing a part of yourself that has always had the capacity for inner knowing to take the lead. (Pause 3s) Children often sense things before they can explain them. You are reconnecting with that capacity. The inner compass has always been there. (Pause 5s) The light is yours. The inner compass is yours. The feeling of inner guidance is yours. (Pause 3s) So as you go back into your day, carry the inner compass with you. When you feel the first flicker of doubt, pause. Breathe. Feel the light in your chest. (Pause 5s) You have everything you need to develop your intuition. You have this experience. You have the image of the inner compass. You have the choice, from now on, to listen to your inner wisdom. (Pause 3s) Let that truth guide you. You have guidance within. You can trust yourself. You know more than you think. There is a compass in your chest. (Pause 3s) Your subconscious has received these suggestions. It will support your intuition in the days and weeks to come.

You can remember that the inner compass is always available. (Pause 5s) You deserve to move through life with the confidence that comes from trusting yourself. You deserve the clarity that intuition brings. (Pause 3s) The inner compass has opened something in you. That opening is permanent. You are developing your intuition. Believe it. Live it. (Pause 5s) And whenever doubt tries to drown out your knowing, you can respond with the inner compass. You know another way. You know the way of listening within. You choose intuition. Again and again. You choose to trust yourself. (Pause 3s) So take this gift with you. The gift of inner wisdom. The gift of the inner compass.

(Pause 5s) You have trained your mind for intuition. That training will stay with you. (Pause 3s) Honour this change. Use it. You deserve to trust your own wisdom. The inner compass is yours for life. (Pause 3s) And as we bring you back to full awareness, hold on to that feeling. You have inner guidance. You can trust yourself. You do not need to have all the answers from outside. (Pause 5s) Your subconscious will remind you. Whenever doubt or confusion rise, you can return to the inner compass. To the light in your chest. To the peace of inner knowing. (Pause 3s) You are a person who trusts their intuition. You have proven it to yourself today. Trust that. Live that. You have guidance. You have the compass.
